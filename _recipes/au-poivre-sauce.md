Classic French bistro vibes. Incredibly simple, high reward, low risk. It pairs with any steak that's beefy enough to contrast with the richness of the sauce. And it's not as peppery as people think—tell them to chill.

## Ingredients

- A good handful of peppercorns (skip the plain black—try green peppercorns, a melange with red, coriander, whatever looks interesting)
- One shallot, finely chopped
- Butter
- One or two cloves of garlic, finely chopped
- A nice pour of brandy, cognac, rum, or bourbon (something with a bit of sweetness)
- Heavy cream
- Beef stock or broth (about twice as much as the cream)
- A knob of cold butter, to finish
- Parsley or chives, for topping

## Steps

1. Smash the peppercorns with a mortar and pestle—not finely ground, just broken up into varying sizes depending on the texture you want.
2. Toast the crushed peppercorns in a dry pan over medium-high heat until you get that pungent peppercorn fragrance, about one to two minutes.
3. Add the butter, shallot, and garlic to the pan. Let the butter melt and stir until everything starts to combine and smells nice.
4. Carefully pour in the brandy (watch out if you're working with an open flame). Let the alcohol evaporate and reduce a bit.
5. Pour in the heavy cream and stir for one to two minutes.
6. Add the beef stock—about twice the amount of cream—and let it simmer, stirring for a few minutes until it reduces to the consistency you want. More cream if you want it richer, more stock if you want it lighter.
7. Finish with a knob of cold butter stirred in.
8. Top with parsley or chives and serve over your steak.
