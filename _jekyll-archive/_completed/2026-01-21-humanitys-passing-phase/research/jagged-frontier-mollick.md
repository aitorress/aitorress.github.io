# Research: Jagged Frontier (Ethan Mollick)

**Date:** 2026-01-23

---

## Summary

Ethan Mollick's "jagged frontier" concept describes AI's uneven capabilities: superhuman at some tasks, failing at others (sometimes simpler ones). The frontier is hard to see in advance. This connects directly to the author's experience ("the tool isn't there yet in every domain") and grounds the "tool needs a wielder" section in research.

## Key Findings

### The Jagged Frontier Defined

The "jagged frontier" is Mollick's metaphor for AI's unpredictable capability boundary. Unlike a smooth line where harder tasks are beyond AI and easier ones are within reach, the frontier is jagged: AI excels at some complex tasks while failing at seemingly simple ones.

> "On some tasks, AI is immensely powerful, and on others, it fails completely or subtly. And, unless you use AI a lot, you won't know which is which."

- **Credibility:** High (peer-reviewed field experiment)
- **How to use:** Explains why "the tool needs a wielder" — someone has to know where the frontier is.

### The BCG Study Results

Field experiment with 758 Boston Consulting Group consultants:

| Metric | Result with AI |
|--------|---------------|
| Tasks completed | 12.2% more |
| Speed | 25.1% faster |
| Quality | 40% higher |

But: For tasks *outside* the frontier, consultants using AI were **19 percentage points less likely** to get correct answers than those without AI.

Key insight: AI makes you better *inside* the frontier, worse *outside* it. The skill is knowing where the line is.

- **Credibility:** High (758 subjects, pre-registered experiment)
- **How to use:** Grounds author's "orders of magnitude improvement" claim in data.

### Skill Leveling Effect

The consultants who scored worst at baseline had the biggest jump (43%) when using AI. Top consultants got a smaller boost.

Implication: AI doesn't just amplify existing skill. It changes the distribution. But someone still needs to know when to trust it.

### Centaurs and Cyborgs

Two strategies for navigating the jagged frontier:

**Centaurs:** Clear division of labor between human and machine. Strategic switching based on who does what best. The human decides what to delegate.

**Cyborgs:** Fully integrated workflow. Continuous back-and-forth with AI. The boundary between human and machine work blurs.

Both approaches outperformed either human-alone or AI-alone. The key is *active navigation* of the frontier.

- **How to use:** "Cyborg" framing connects to Andy Clark. The author's practice ("pushing boundaries of the tool and myself") is cyborg behavior.

### Bottlenecks Protect Human Value

> "Jaggedness creates bottlenecks, and bottlenecks mean that even very smart AI cannot easily substitute for humans. At least not yet."

Jobs don't disappear just because AI is superhuman at some tasks. The jagged frontier means human judgment remains essential for:
- Knowing what's inside vs. outside the frontier
- Handling tasks on the "failing" side of the line
- Collecting information and building buy-in
- Understanding unwritten rules

- **How to use:** Reinforces author's "tool needs a wielder" — the wielder navigates the jaggedness.

## Connection to the Piece

The jagged frontier concept bridges:
- **Author's experience:** "The tool isn't there yet in every domain" = the frontier is jagged
- **Andy Clark's cyborg:** The most effective users become cyborgs, blurring human-AI boundaries
- **Homo habilis framing:** Each tool-relationship required learning where the tool worked and where it didn't

The piece can use "jagged frontier" to make the practitioner section concrete and research-backed.
