# Draft Analysis: The Unbundling of Work

**Date:** 2026-01-27

## Core Idea

AI will automate *tasks* within jobs rather than eliminate jobs wholesale, but this "unbundling" may still dramatically reshape work in uncomfortable ways that force us to confront whether we're more than the sum of our tasks.

## Piece Type

**Tension-driven** — The piece presents an ostensibly optimistic framing (jobs survive, you're like a carpenter with power tools) while systematically undermining that comfort (maybe you're the switchboard operator, not the carpenter). The tension between reassurance and existential discomfort is the engine of the piece.

## What's Working

- **The Steel Man section is genuinely strong.** David Autor's research, the ATM paradox, comparative advantage within jobs, and the power tools analogy form a solid empirical foundation. These aren't just assertions.

- **The Devil's Advocate section effectively undermines the main argument's comfort.** The "survivor bias problem" with the power tools analogy and the "job consolidation vs. job preservation" distinction are sharp counterpoints.

- **"The Tension You're Sensing" section articulates the existential question clearly.** "Am I more than the sum of my tasks?" is the right question, and the piece knows it.

- **Several Raw Material items are sharp and quotable:**
  - "Middle management is, in large part, the human API layer..."
  - "Jobs don't disappear; they deflate."
  - "The optimist says: I'll do the interesting parts. The pessimist asks: what if someone else's interesting parts were your job?"

- **The Adjacent Ideas section provides solid intellectual context.** Autor, Coase, Newport, and the gig economy framing are all relevant and well-chosen.

## Gaps to Fill

### Needs Research

1. **The radiologist claim** — "scan-reading was 80% of the role's economic value" is asserted but not supported. Need actual data on radiologist task breakdown and how AI is affecting the field.

2. **"Middle management gets squeezed first"** — This is a strong claim presented without evidence. Are there examples of companies already restructuring middle management due to AI? Early data on this would strengthen the argument.

3. **Bank teller story needs depth** — The draft itself flags this in "Next Steps." The piece uses the ATM paradox as a key example but admits the story is "more nuanced than 'they survived.'" Need: What happened to wages? Were the same people retained? How did the job actually change?

4. **What actually happened to switchboard operators, typists, elevator operators** — These are used as counter-examples to the carpenter analogy, but the piece doesn't examine them. How fast did these jobs decline? Did workers transition to other roles, or were they simply displaced?

5. **Concrete examples of AI already unbundling knowledge work** — The piece is theoretical. Are there specific companies, roles, or industries where task unbundling is already visible? Legal discovery, customer service, content creation?

### Needs Author Input

1. **Personal experience with task unbundling** — The piece is abstract. Does the author have tasks in their own work that AI now handles or could handle? Personal stakes would ground the argument and make it less purely analytical.

2. **The "meaningful work" question** — Question 7 asks: "Are there tasks you *don't want* to offload because doing them is part of why the job is meaningful?" Does the author have an answer? This could become a powerful section about what we *want* to keep, not just what we can't automate.

3. **The author's actual answer to the core question** — The piece asks "Am I more than the sum of my tasks?" but doesn't commit to an answer. Is the author optimistic, pessimistic, or genuinely uncertain? Readers will want to know where the author lands.

### Needs More Thinking

1. **The transition speed problem** — This is raised in Devil's Advocate ("If AI compresses the same transformation into 5 years...") but not developed. How fast is too fast? What's the policy response? Is there a historical parallel for rapid occupational restructuring?

2. **"New jobs emerge around AI orchestration"** — This is asserted but underdeveloped. What do these jobs actually look like? Is "prompt engineer" genuinely a job, or a skill within other jobs? What's the shape of AI-adjacent work?

3. **The surveillance/measurement dystopia** — Second-Order Effects flags "more granular productivity monitoring, with all the dystopian potential that implies" but doesn't explore it. How bad could it get? Is there resistance emerging? This feels like it could be its own section or a separate piece.

4. **The Coase connection** — "If AI reduces coordination costs, does Coase's logic change?" is a fascinating question that's just mentioned. This could be developed: Does AI favor smaller firms (less internal coordination needed) or larger ones (can deploy AI at scale)?

## Consider Cutting

- **The "Questions Worth Exploring" section** — Many of these could be folded into the body as rhetorical questions or cut entirely. As written, they feel like notes to self rather than article content. The strong ones (Q1, Q6, Q7) could be integrated; the weaker ones can go.

- **Some Adjacent Ideas connections are weaker than others** — Buckminster Fuller's "ephemeralization" feels like a stretch to include. The Coase and Autor connections are strong; Fuller adds less.

- **The "Next Steps" section** — This is clearly internal working notes, not article content. It should inform the author's process but won't appear in the final piece.

## Recommended Next Step

**Run /draft-research first** to fill the factual gaps:
- Radiologist AI data and task breakdown
- Bank teller post-ATM details (wages, transition, job transformation)
- Concrete examples of AI unbundling knowledge work now
- What happened to switchboard operators, typists (speed of decline, worker outcomes)

**Then run /draft-input** to get the author's personal stakes and position on the core existential question. The piece will be stronger if the author commits to an answer rather than leaving "Am I more than my tasks?" purely rhetorical.
