## **We’re Building With Fire and No Blueprint**

The state of GenAI in the enterprise? **Controlled chaos - minus the “controlled” part.**

It’s not that things are broken. Quite the opposite - there’s motion, momentum, and a steady stream of “AI wins” showing up in demos and vendor products.

But zoom out, and the pattern’s clear: **everyone’s building, everyone’s buying, nobody’s aligning**.

The CEO wants “AI.” What does that even mean?

Marketing wants summaries, copy generation - and now images, too.

Legal is looking for red flag detection across contracts.

Customer service wants a voice assistant - but so does sales, and they already have one.

Meanwhile, someone in procurement is quietly signing a contract with **yet another vendor** that promises “AI-powered data pipelines” - reality check: it’s just smoke and mirrors. 

You can’t blame them. The tools are compelling. The possibilities feel endless.

But the collective output? **Noise - not signal.**

No shared vision. No reusable systems. Just team after team sprinting in different directions — often toward the same destination, but building different roads to get there.

And even when everyone’s using the same vendor and targeting the same user, the outputs don’t just vary - they contradict each other. One team grounds on the help center, another on internal docs, a third on a rogue SharePoint from 2021. Same company, same product, three different answers to the same question. The user experience? Whiplash. Confused customers. Frustrated teams. And a growing sense that your AI is less “intelligent assistant” and more “corporate hallucination engine.”

While some companies still treat AI like a moonshot initiative, the serious ones already see it for what it is: **table stakes**.

It’s no longer about proving GenAI can work. It’s about making it work across the org - safely, consistently, and without needing a dozen reinventions of the same wheel.

Here’s the tension:

Most GenAI projects don’t fail because the tech isn’t ready.

They fail because the **organization isn’t**.

They don’t have the patterns.

They don’t have the platform.

They don’t share the same mental model.

So what do you do when every team wants a Copilot, but the org doesn’t have a compass?

You don’t build more copilots.

You build the compass.

## Stop Building AI Projects. Start Building the Platform.

**If your AI team is acting like an internal agency - chasing requests from execs, juggling demos, shipping bespoke solutions - you’re not scaling AI. You’re scaling chaos.**

It feels productive. It even looks impressive. But it doesn’t hold. The more you build, the more you owe - in support, maintenance, and strategy debt. You become a machine that feeds itself problems. This isn’t enablement. You’re not a strategy team. You’re the world’s busiest fire department.

The smarter move?

**Build the system others can build on.**

Lay the groundwork.

Shift from being the builders-of-all to the team that makes **everyone else faster, safer, and smarter.**

That starts with primitives.

You don’t need dozens of GenAI products. You need a handful of **reliable, reusable capabilities** - summarization, retrieval, generation, classification, evaluation - and a way to plug them in across the org.

That’s the unlock.

**Finite components. Infinite combinations.**

You standardize a chunking pipeline, and five teams build RAG apps overnight.

You harden a summarizer, and legal, support, and product ops start solving their own problems.

You ship one evaluation harness, and it becomes the default for rollout decisions org-wide.

And here’s the hidden bonus: **governance becomes built-in.**

You don’t have to explain prompt safety guidelines in five different Slack channels. You ship those guidelines in the SDK.

You don’t need to micromanage - you design systems that self-regulate.

This is how scale works:

Not by doing more, but by **doing less - better**, and letting the system compound over time.

You stop building one-offs.

You start building leverage.

## The AI Team Shouldn’t Build Everything and That’s the Point

Here’s the paradox:

**Every team wants AI.**

But no single team can possibly build it all.

And honestly, it’s not your job to try.

You’re not the catch-all AI factory. You’re the team that builds the *starting blocks*, defines the lanes, and hands out the toolkit. The real leverage doesn’t come from centralizing every use case - it comes from **distributing the ability to build**, responsibly.

Because here’s what’s often missed:

**The people who know *what* needs to be built are already in the room.**

They’re sitting in legal, product, finance, and support.

They’re not AI experts - but they are experts.

And they know the edge cases, the workflows, the tone, and the risk tolerance better than anyone else.

Your job is to make sure they’re not starting from zero. That means giving them solid building blocks - retrieval, summarization, prompt runners, eval layers - that don’t need to be rebuilt from scratch. It means offering strong opinions on how those blocks are wired together. It means writing the documentation that answers questions before they get asked, and offering guidance that scales better than Slack threads and live reviews. Most of all, it means embedding governance into the tools themselves - so responsible use becomes the default, not an afterthought

This is where enablement stops being a vibe and starts being a system. A **Capability Catalog** tells teams exactly what the AI platform can do - no guessing, no Slack archaeology. Paired with **Solution Playbooks**, it becomes a permission slip to build without waiting in line. “Here’s what works. Here’s how to use it. Here’s what to avoid.” It’s not documentation. **It’s leverage at scale**. **The tools teach. The patterns guide**. And your team isn’t in the middle of every decision - just the ones that move the strategy, not the sprint.

And no, **enablement doesn’t mean chaos.**

It means you **build systems that support variation without inviting drift**. You set standards without stifling creativity. You make it easier for the people closest to the problem to solve it - without spawning five unmaintainable copilots that don’t share any DNA.

So what’s the AI team’s real role?

You’re the architect.

The teacher.

The partner.

The guardrail.

And the reason the rest of the org can move fast without flying off the rails.

That’s how you scale AI: not by doing everything, but by making it easier - and safer - for everyone else to do the right thing.

## Build the System That Builds AI

If you’re shaping how your AI org works - this is the moment that defines whether you scale or stall.

It’s not about how many copilots you build. It’s about how many teams can build their own - safely, consistently, and without needing to reinvent every decision.

**AI works. Your competitors figured that out a few quarters ago.**

What matters now is stitching it into the fabric of how your company solves problems - again and again, without heroics.

It’s not about chasing use cases. It’s about architecting the system that lets use cases emerge, evolve, and multiply without breaking six months later.

That system isn’t just infra.

It’s not just SDKs or model registries.

It’s people. Tooling. Governance. Standards. The patterns others follow when nobody’s looking.

You know you’ve done it right when your team builds less and ships more, through others.

When the questions shift from “Can we do this?” to “What’s the cleanest way to slot this in?”

When your value isn’t tied to velocity, but to **leverage**.

So here’s the challenge:

Don’t scale humans.

**Scale leverage.**

**Build the system that builds AI** - not just in theory, but in practice.

Across departments. Across teams. **Across decisions that haven’t even been made yet.**

Because that’s the real work.

Not chasing the demo.

But laying the groundwork that turns sparks into fire - **and fire into progress that compounds.**

**This is leverage.**

**This is AI as a Service.**
