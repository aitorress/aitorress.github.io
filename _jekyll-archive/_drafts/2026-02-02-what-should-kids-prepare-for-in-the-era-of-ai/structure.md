# Structure Proposal: What Should Kids Prepare For in the Era of AI?

**Status:** Approved
**Date:** 2026-02-02

---

## Core Argument

The skills that make you resilient to AI disruption are exactly the skills that AI disrupts your ability to build—which means preparing kids for uncertainty itself, not specific careers.

## Piece Type

**Tension-driven** — paradox at center, challenges conventional parenting wisdom, resolves with a stance rather than a prescription.

## Headings

**Yes** — The piece runs ~1,500-2,000 words with distinct phases (setup, paradox, evidence, counterpoint, resolution). Headings help navigation without fragmenting the argument. Hook and close need no headings; middle sections benefit from signposting.

---

## Proposed Outline

### 1. [No heading — opening hook]

**Purpose:** Establish the broken heuristic and the parenting honesty angle. Ground the piece in personal stakes before going analytical.

**Content:**
- The old career guidance is scrambled: "engineer" used to mean relief, "artist" meant crossed fingers
- When your kid asks what to study, you say "whatever makes you happy"
- But that answer comes from honest uncertainty, not wisdom
- You're bullish on coding principles and creativity both—but can't rank them

**Source:** Author input (dinner table reality), draft opening

**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph (150-200 words)

**Tone:** Personal, slightly vulnerable. Not the typical confident opening.

---

### 2. The Burden Falls on the Wrong People

**Purpose:** Name the asymmetric impact—experienced professionals are insulated; new entrants bear the risk.

**Content:**
- Mid-career professionals have tacit knowledge, judgment, context—hard to automate
- Even under aggressive AGI timelines, they'll experience transition, not shock
- Adoption lag matters: AI capability ≠ instant organizational change
- The real uncertainty burden falls on people entering the workforce
- By extension, on the kids we're trying to prepare

**Source:** Draft (The Seed), analysis

**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph (150-200 words)

---

### 3. AI Is a Multiplier, Not a Substitute

**Purpose:** Introduce the core mental model. Set up the paradox.

**Content:**
- AI amplifies whatever is already there: skills, judgment, flaws
- If you're smart and disciplined, AI makes you more so
- If you're sloppy and uncurious, AI amplifies that too
- Current AI still hallucinates, sounds confident when wrong
- Someone must know what "good" looks like
- This is why experienced people win (for now)—they can guide, review, reject

**Source:** Draft (The Seed, Steel Man)

**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph (150-200 words)

---

### 4. The Catch-22 for New Entrants

**Purpose:** Name the paradox explicitly. This is the core tension the piece revolves around.

**Content:**
- Everyone around them uses AI; they must use AI to keep pace
- But they don't have deep skills, judgment, or taste yet
- If they rely on AI: they don't build fundamentals
- If they avoid AI: they fall behind peers
- **The paradox:** They don't yet have anything for AI to multiply

**Source:** Draft (The Seed), Raw Material one-liners

**Estimated length:** Short-medium paragraph (100-150 words). Tight, punchy.

---

### 5. I've Seen This at Work

**Purpose:** Ground the paradox in concrete observation. Make it real, not theoretical.

**Content:**
- The ticket completion problem: engineers reward-hacking for metrics
- You can see when there was no human review—the work is poor quality
- Downstream effect: seniors spend time catching errors instead of building
- This increases their skepticism of AI
- **The spiral:** Juniors misuse AI → seniors clean up → seniors become skeptical → adoption slows → but juniors still aren't building fundamentals

**Source:** Author input (ticket completion example)

**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph (150-200 words)

---

### 6. The Calculator Came After the Multiplication Tables

**Purpose:** Historical grounding. Show this isn't unprecedented—but the workforce context is different.

**Content:**
- Schools figured out sequencing: fundamentals first (K-5), calculators introduced grades 6-7
- Research confirms: premature use creates dependency; appropriate use doesn't harm development
- "Calculators cannot replace understanding mathematical concepts"
- **But:** Schools had decades to figure this out
- The workforce has no "fundamentals-first" phase—you're expected to use AI immediately
- The tool arrives before the judgment to evaluate it

**Source:** Research (calculator transition), draft analogy

**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph (150-200 words)

---

### 7. The Evidence Is Worse Than the Theory

**Purpose:** Hard data that sharpens the paradox. The jagged frontier study.

**Content:**
- Harvard/BCG study: 758 consultants using GPT-4
- Inside AI's capability boundary: +12% more tasks, +25% faster, +40% quality
- **Outside the frontier:** Novices experienced a 19-percentage-point performance DROP
- Experts succeeded by identifying and rejecting flawed AI suggestions
- The jagged frontier: you can't know where it is without expertise
- "AI is most useful to the people who need it least"

**Source:** Research (jagged frontier study), Foundation Paradox draft

**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph (150-200 words)

---

### 8. But Maybe Fundamentals Are Changing

**Purpose:** Steel-man the counterargument. Acknowledge uncertainty honestly.

**Content:**
- The "build fundamentals first" assumption might be historical, not necessary
- A generation fluent in AI tools from childhood may develop different judgment
- We worried calculators would erode mathematical intuition—maybe it did, maybe it didn't matter
- The creative reversal hypothesis has survivorship bias: top-tier creative work requires depth, but the middle is being hollowed out
- Telling kids "be creative" may be accurate at the top of the distribution and catastrophic for the median

**Source:** Draft (Devil's Advocate), analysis

**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph (150-200 words)

---

### 9. The Path Is the Same Regardless

**Purpose:** The author's resolution. Timeline-agnostic preparation.

**Content:**
- I don't have an AGI prediction, and I don't think it matters
- Whether it's Amodei's 2027 or Hassabis's 2030, the preparation path is the same
- Value will be derived by smart people at every step until we reach AGI/ASI
- This period is either the destination or the training ground—either way, the work is the same
- The people I admire most are both highly creative AND experts in their domain
- Not creativity OR technical skill—the combination

**Source:** Author input (timeline-agnostic position, creativity + expertise)

**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph (150-200 words)

---

### 10. [No heading — closing]

**Purpose:** Land the piece. Return to the parenting frame. Acknowledge uncertainty without despair.

**Content:**
- So what do I tell my kids? Study what makes you happy.
- Not because it's safe advice—because the honest answer is "I don't know"
- But also: build something worth multiplying. Develop taste. Go deep somewhere.
- The skills that make you resilient are the skills AI makes easy to skip
- That's the paradox. It doesn't resolve neatly.
- Prepare them for uncertainty itself—because that's what's certain.

**Source:** Author input, draft closing, Raw Material

**Estimated length:** Short paragraph (100-150 words). Land it cleanly.

## What's Not Included

| Material | Reason for cutting |
|----------|-------------------|
| First-order effects list (bifurcated careers, credential devaluation, etc.) | Kitchen-sink; dilutes the central paradox |
| Second-order effects (apprenticeship revival, geographic reshuffling, etc.) | Interesting but speculative; belongs in a different piece |
| Adjacent Ideas section (Autor, Ericsson, Newport, Taleb references) | Academic throat-clearing; the ideas are woven in where relevant |
| Questions Worth Exploring | These are for the author's thinking, not the reader |
| The class dimension | Raised then dropped in the draft; either develop fully or cut. Cutting. |
| Heavy AGI timeline speculation | Author explicitly said this isn't important to the argument |

## Material to Pull from Existing Posts

The piece should link to (not reproduce) related ideas:

- **"The Unbundling of Work"** — when discussing how jobs transform (section 2)
- **"The Human Edge"** — when discussing what becomes valuable (section 9)
- Brief mentions only; this piece should stand alone.

## Open Questions for Author

1. **Title:** "What Should Kids Prepare For in the Era of AI?" is functional but not punchy. Alternatives:
   - "The Multiplication Problem"
   - "Nothing to Multiply"
   - "What I Tell My Kids About AI"
   - Keep the original?

2. **The ticket completion example:** How much detail do you want? I've kept it high-level—should it be more specific (e.g., specific code patterns, review processes)?

3. **The close:** I've returned to "study what makes you happy" but added "build something worth multiplying." Does that land, or does it feel like adding a prescription to an honest shrug?

## Alternative Structures Considered

**Alternative A: Lead with the data**
Open with the jagged frontier study (19% novice drop), then explain why. More "hook with surprising stat" style.

*Rejected because:* The parenting frame is more distinctive. Data-first opening is common; the honest uncertainty angle is rarer and more aligned with author voice.

**Alternative B: Shorter, punchier (800 words)**
Cut the evidence sections, trust the paradox to carry the piece.

*Rejected because:* The paradox needs grounding. Without the ticket completion example and calculator research, it's too abstract.

**Alternative C: End with questions, not a stance**
Exploration piece rather than tension-driven. Leave it genuinely unresolved.

*Rejected because:* Author input provided a stance (timeline-agnostic, creativity + expertise). The piece has a landing; it should use it.
