# Research: Internal Blog Connections

*Researched: 2026-02-02*

## Summary

Four published posts and two drafts directly connect to the AI career preparation themes. These form a coherent framework: the AI career prep article sits at the intersection of all of them. The pieces address the same underlying questions from different angles—what remains valuable, how jobs transform, why fundamentals matter, and what kind of depth to develop.

## Critical Connections (Must Reference)

### 1. The Unbundling of Work (Published)

**File:** `_posts/2026-01-19-the-unbundling-of-work.md`
**Themes:** AI as multiplier, new-entrant paradox, asymmetric impact, calculator analogy

**Why it matters:** This post is foundational. It establishes that AI automates *tasks* not *jobs*, and that the timeline for job transformation varies dramatically (40 years for bank teller wages to drop, 86 years for telephone operators to disappear). The "jagged frontier" concept explains why job survival depends on having tasks that fall on the human side.

**Key quotes:**
- "Automation affects tasks first, employment later. The question is: how much later? Telephone operators had decades. We might have years."
- The ATM/bank teller historical parallel: tasks got replaced but jobs transformed

**How to use:** Reference when explaining the asymmetric impact thesis—experienced professionals have time to adapt, but compressed timelines hit new entrants hardest. The ATM/teller data strengthens the calculator analogy.

**Link direction:** Link TO this from the AI career prep article.

### 2. The Human Edge (Published)

**File:** `_posts/2025-09-02-the-human-edge.md`
**Themes:** AI as multiplier, asymmetric impact, creative reversal, depth vs breadth

**Why it matters:** Directly answers "what remains valuable when intelligence becomes cheap?" The answer: curation, signal, and trust. The flywheel concept (Curation → Signal → Trust) explains how human judgment compounds rather than scales.

**Key quotes:**
- "The traits that used to be 'soft skills'—taste, perspective, trust—just became the hard currency of relevance."
- "AI makes human limitations valuable. Our biases, our particular angles, our inability to be purely objective—these become our competitive advantages."
- "The future isn't less human. It's more. AI doesn't erase what we bring. It makes the human edge sharper."

**How to use:** Reference when discussing what skills kids should develop. Provides a more sophisticated answer than "be creative"—the answer is judgment, curation, and trust-building, which require experience and can't be shortcut.

**Link direction:** Link TO this from the AI career prep article.

### 3. The Foundation Paradox (Draft)

**File:** `_drafts/2026-01-21-the-foundation-paradox.md`
**Themes:** AI as multiplier, new-entrant paradox, calculator analogy, depth vs breadth

**Why it matters:** This draft is almost a mirror image of the AI career prep article. It argues that AI makes fundamentals *more* important, not less—because you need domain knowledge to evaluate AI output.

**Key quotes:**
- "AI is most useful to the people who need it least."
- "The skills AI makes most 'obsolete' are precisely the ones you need to use AI effectively."
- "The tedium isn't overhead; it's tuition."

**How to use:** This draft explores WHY the new-entrant paradox is real. The AI career prep article could directly dialogue with it—acknowledge the paradox and then explore what to actually do about it for kids.

**Link direction:** Mutual cross-reference. These pieces are complementary.

### 4. Vibecoding vs. AI Expertise (Draft)

**File:** `_drafts/2026-01-30-vibecoding-vs-ai-expertise.md`
**Themes:** AI as multiplier, creative reversal, depth vs breadth

**Why it matters:** Directly operationalizes the "AI as multiplier" concept with the vertical/horizontal expansion framework. Non-experts expand horizontally (many things, shallow); experts expand vertically (deep, exceptional output).

**Key quotes:**
- "AI is a multiplier, and what you multiply matters. Deep expertise × AI = exceptional output. Shallow understanding × AI = lots of adequate output."
- "Expertise isn't replaced by AI—it becomes a force multiplier for it."
- "You need either speed (horizontal) or depth (vertical)."

**How to use:** Provides vocabulary for discussing what kind of skill development matters. The question of whether "vibecoding" (horizontal expansion) is a dead end or stepping stone is directly relevant to what kids should do.

**Link direction:** Mutual cross-reference with AI career prep article.

## High Relevance (Should Reference)

### 5. Still Handy (Published)

**File:** `_posts/2026-01-23-still-handy.md`
**Themes:** AI as multiplier, asymmetric impact

**Why it matters:** Philosophical grounding for the idea that tool adaptation is historically normal. Hinton's "passing phase" reframed as evolution, not extinction.

**Key insight:** Tool mastery has always looked like learning where tools extend you and where they mislead. This transitions have happened before.

**How to use:** Reference when discussing parental anxiety and historical parallels. Provides reassurance that adaptation is normal while acknowledging the stakes are real.

### 6. Amara's Law / Trough of Disillusionment (Draft)

**File:** `_drafts/2026-01-19-amaras-law-and-the-trough-of-disillusionment.md`
**Themes:** Asymmetric impact, calculator analogy

**Why it matters:** We overestimate technology impact in short run, underestimate in long run. The transition period is where people get hurt.

**Key insight:** "The long run is just a series of short runs in which everyone who was wrong has been replaced."

**How to use:** When discussing the calculator transition timeline. Even if the end result is positive, the middle period is painful for people in transition.

## Framework for Linking

The AI career prep article sits at the center of these pieces:

```
                    [The Human Edge]
                    "What's valuable"
                           ↑
[Foundation Paradox] ←→ [AI Career Prep] ←→ [Vibecoding vs Expertise]
"Why fundamentals"        for Kids         "What kind of depth"
                           ↓
                 [The Unbundling of Work]
                 "How jobs transform"
```

**Suggested approach:** Rather than embedding links throughout, consider a "Related Reading" section that maps the territory:
- "The Foundation Paradox explores why AI makes fundamentals more important, not less"
- "The Unbundling of Work shows how jobs survive automation (and the timelines involved)"
- "Vibecoding vs AI Expertise asks what kind of depth matters"
- "The Human Edge explains what becomes valuable when knowledge is cheap"

## Specific Material to Pull

### From The Unbundling of Work:
- ATM/bank teller data: "The number of bank tellers actually increased after ATMs were introduced... But here's the catch: wages started declining 40 years after ATMs appeared."
- Timeline compression concern: "Telephone operators had decades. We might have years."

### From The Human Edge:
- The curation flywheel as answer to "what should kids develop"
- "Taste, perspective, trust—just became the hard currency of relevance"

### From The Foundation Paradox:
- "AI is most useful to the people who need it least" — perfect one-liner for the new-entrant paradox
- The productive struggle argument: "The tedium isn't overhead; it's tuition"

### From Vibecoding vs Expertise:
- The multiplier equation: "Deep expertise × AI = exceptional output. Shallow understanding × AI = lots of adequate output"
- The question of whether horizontal expansion leads anywhere
