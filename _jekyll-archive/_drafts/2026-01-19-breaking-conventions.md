# Breaking Conventions: The Paradox of Interesting Work

## The Seed

As soon as convention is established, the most interesting work would be the one that doesn't follow it.

## Steel Man

Convention is, by definition, the expected. It's the baseline. The moment something becomes "how things are done," it also becomes the invisible wallpaper of a domain—present everywhere, noticed by no one.

Interesting work creates information. Information, in the Shannon sense, is surprise. You can't surprise anyone by doing what they already expected. Therefore, mathematically, the most interesting work *must* diverge from convention. The convention is the null hypothesis; interesting work is the signal that rises above the noise.

This isn't just aesthetic theory—it's how attention works. Our brains literally filter out the predictable. We don't see the furniture in our own homes. We stop hearing the hum of the refrigerator. Convention is neurological wallpaper. To be *seen*, you must be different.

History backs this up relentlessly. Impressionism mattered because academic painting had calcified. Punk mattered because prog rock had become indulgent. The iPhone mattered because phones had converged on physical keyboards. Every paradigm shift is, definitionally, a convention break. You cannot name a single transformative work that was praised for being perfectly conventional.

The strongest version of this argument: convention is evidence of a solved problem space. Once conventions exist, all the value has been extracted from that approach. The frontier has moved. Staying conventional is, literally, fighting yesterday's war.

## Devil's Advocate

Here's where this breaks down: **breaking convention is trivially easy; breaking it well is nearly impossible.**

Any fool can be different. I could write this essay in Wingdings. That would break convention. It would not be interesting—it would be annoying. The graveyard of creative work is full of pieces that were different for difference's sake, mistaking novelty for insight.

The uncomfortable truth: most convention-breaking work is *worse* than conventional work. Conventions often encode hard-won wisdom. The three-act structure exists because it maps to how humans process narrative. The QWERTY keyboard survived because switching costs matter more than optimization. Breaking conventions without understanding why they exist produces work that is merely confused, not revolutionary.

There's also a survivorship bias problem. We remember the convention-breakers who succeeded. We don't remember the thousands who broke the same conventions and failed because they had nothing to say. Picasso could break conventions because he could also paint like the Old Masters when he chose to. Most people can't do the conventional version well, so their "breaks" are just incompetence dressed as innovation.

And here's the real knife: **the meta-convention of breaking conventions is now itself a convention.** In many creative fields, transgression is expected. The MFA student who writes a traditional short story is now the rebel. When everyone zigs, the most interesting move might be to zag back.

## First-Order Effects

If this principle is true:

1. **Established fields become attention traps.** The more developed a convention set, the harder it is to do interesting work within it. You'd rationally flee to newer domains with less established norms.

2. **Timing becomes everything.** The same unconventional move is revolutionary early and derivative late. Breaking conventions has a half-life.

3. **Education becomes double-edged.** Learning conventions deeply is necessary to break them meaningfully, but also risks internalizing them so thoroughly that breaking them becomes psychologically difficult.

4. **Critics become essential and inadequate.** You need someone to articulate why the convention-break worked, but critics trained on old conventions will initially reject new work.

5. **Commercial success and interestingness diverge.** Conventions exist partly because they're commercially safe. Breaking them creates interesting work but increases variance in outcomes.

## Second-Order Effects

Following the ripples further:

- **Convention-breaking becomes industrialized.** Once this principle is understood, you get deliberate transgression factories—art schools, venture capital, "disruptive innovation" consultants—systematically trying to identify and break conventions. This paradoxically accelerates convention formation, as yesterday's breaks become today's new norms.

- **Authenticity becomes impossible to verify.** If breaking conventions is the path to being interesting, people will perform convention-breaking strategically. You can no longer tell if someone's unconventional approach reflects genuine vision or calculated positioning.

- **Nostalgia becomes a valid creative strategy.** When breaking conventions is conventional, returning to older conventions becomes the transgressive act. This explains the cyclical nature of fashion, art movements, and startup ideas ("It's like X, but we're bringing back feature Y that everyone abandoned").

- **The "interesting" elite separates from the masses.** Convention exists because it enables coordination. If the most interesting work rejects convention, it becomes increasingly inaccessible to anyone not steeped in the meta-conversation about which conventions are being broken and why.

- **Domains fork between craft and art.** Some practitioners will optimize for "doing the thing well" (convention-following) while others optimize for "advancing the thing" (convention-breaking). These become different career paths with different audiences.

## The Tension You're Sensing

You're circling something deeper here: **the relationship between legibility and value.**

Conventions make work legible. They give audiences a framework to understand what they're seeing. Breaking conventions destroys that legibility—which is precisely what creates the sense of encountering something new, but also what makes convention-breaking work feel alienating, confusing, or "not for me."

The real question you're asking is: **Can work be both interesting and accessible?** Or is there an inherent trade-off between creating information (surprise) and enabling comprehension (patterns)?

There's also a tension between individual expression and collective progress. Conventions are how knowledge accumulates across generations. They're the ratchet that prevents us from re-deriving everything from first principles. Breaking conventions might be individually interesting but collectively costly.

You might be asking: **Is "interesting" even the right goal?** Interesting to whom? For how long? There's conventional work that endures because it perfectly executes a timeless form, and convention-breaking work that's forgotten because it was only interesting in opposition to a context that no longer exists.

## Adjacent Ideas / Connections

**Thomas Kuhn's paradigm shifts.** In *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*, Kuhn showed that science doesn't progress linearly—it alternates between "normal science" (convention-following) and revolutions (convention-breaking). The most important scientific work is definitionally paradigm-violating.

**Harold Bloom's "anxiety of influence."** Bloom argued that poets achieve greatness by creatively misreading their predecessors—by breaking with tradition while remaining in dialogue with it. Convention-breaking that ignores what came before is just ignorance; meaningful breaks require deep engagement.

**Brian Eno on "scenius."** Eno coined the term to describe the collective genius of creative scenes. Conventions emerge from scenes; breaking conventions requires a scene to break against. The lone genius myth obscures how convention-breaking is always social.

**Viktor Shklovsky's "defamiliarization."** The Russian Formalist argued that art's purpose is to make the familiar strange—to break the conventions of perception so we see things anew. Convention-breaking isn't just aesthetic preference; it's the mechanism by which art works.

**Nassim Taleb on "antifragility."** Systems that benefit from shocks and disorder are antifragile. Conventions are fragile (they break). Convention-breakers might be antifragile—gaining strength from the resistance they encounter.

**Marshall McLuhan's "the medium is the message."** When a new medium emerges, early content copies old conventions (films were filmed plays; early websites were brochures). True innovation comes from discovering what the new medium does that the old one couldn't. Convention-breaking is often medium-discovering.

## Questions Worth Exploring

1. **The inversion:** What would it mean for conventional work to be the most interesting? Are there domains where this is true? (Craftsmanship traditions, perhaps—a perfectly conventional piece of Shaker furniture is deeply interesting precisely because the conventions are so demanding.)

2. **Who benefits from this belief?** Does "breaking conventions is interesting" serve as ideology for people who either can't or won't do conventional work well? Is it a cope or a genuine insight?

3. **Historical parallel:** The Romantic movement made similar claims—genius breaks rules. How did that play out? Did it produce more interesting work, or just different conventions around the performance of rule-breaking?

4. **The edge case:** What about domains with life-or-death conventions? Aviation checklists. Surgical protocols. Is convention-breaking interesting there, or just reckless?

5. **The temporal dimension:** Is convention-breaking interesting in the moment, or only in retrospect? Can you actually identify interesting convention-breaks in real-time, or does it require historical distance?

6. **The skill question:** Does this principle apply differently at different skill levels? Is a master breaking conventions fundamentally different from a novice breaking them?

7. **The audience problem:** Conventions exist to communicate. If breaking conventions makes work interesting but uncommunicative, who is it for?

## Raw Material

- "Convention is the fossil record of solved problems."

- "Every convention was once a heresy."

- "Breaking conventions is trivially easy; breaking them well is nearly impossible. The Wingdings test: would writing this in Wingdings make it interesting?"

- "The half-life of transgression: the same move is revolutionary early and derivative late."

- "When everyone zigs, the most interesting move might be to zag back."

- "Convention is neurological wallpaper—we literally stop seeing it. To be seen, you must be different."

- "The MFA paradox: the student who writes a traditional short story is now the rebel."

- "Picasso could paint like the Old Masters. That's why his convention-breaks meant something."

- "Information, in the Shannon sense, is surprise. Convention is zero-information. Interesting is high-information."

- "Convention makes work legible. Breaking convention makes work visible. The best work somehow does both."

## Next Steps

1. **Research:** Look into how the Impressionists were received in real-time vs. how we narrativize them now. Was their convention-breaking obvious to contemporaries, or only clear in retrospect?

2. **Test the inversion:** Identify 3-5 pieces of deeply interesting work that are perfectly conventional. What makes them interesting despite (or because of?) following all the rules?

3. **Talk to practitioners:** Find someone who works in a highly conventional field (law? accounting? liturgical music?) and ask what "interesting work" means to them. Does the convention-breaking principle apply, or is their frame entirely different?
