# Vibecoding vs. AI Expertise: Horizontal and Vertical Expansion

## The Seed

Non-experts use vibecoding to expand horizontally—they can now build many apps, prototype quickly, ship things that would have been impossible before. Experts use AI differently: they expand vertically, using their knowledge to elevate the model's capabilities, push past its defaults, and build things neither human nor AI could produce alone.

## Steel Man

This framing captures something real about leverage and skill interaction.

**For horizontal expansion:** Vibecoding genuinely democratizes creation. Someone with zero programming background can now build functional apps by describing what they want. The barrier isn't "can you code?"—it's "can you articulate what you want?" This unlocks a massive population of builders who were previously locked out. The value isn't in any single app being exceptional; it's in the sheer volume of ideas that now get tested. A thousand mediocre apps trying different things produces more signal about what works than a handful of carefully engineered ones. Horizontal expansion is exploration at scale.

**For vertical expansion:** Experts don't just use AI as a faster keyboard—they use it as a thinking partner they can correct, redirect, and elevate. They know when the AI is confidently wrong. They can decompose problems in ways that play to the model's strengths. They bring context the model doesn't have: performance constraints, security implications, organizational politics, maintenance burden. Most importantly, they can recognize when the AI is stuck in a local maximum and push it toward better territory. The expert isn't replaced by AI; they become a force multiplier *for* it.

The strongest version of this argument: AI is a multiplier, and what you multiply matters. Deep expertise × AI = exceptional output. Shallow understanding × AI = lots of adequate output. Both are valid strategies for different goals.

## Devil's Advocate

The horizontal/vertical distinction might be too clean. Several holes:

**The expertise ceiling might be lower than you think.** If AI keeps improving, the "elevation" experts provide shrinks. What required deep knowledge last year might be promptable this year. The expert's vertical advantage could be a temporary artifact of current model limitations, not a durable edge.

**Horizontal expansion can become vertical.** The vibecoder who ships 50 apps develops taste, pattern recognition, and eventually... expertise. They're not stuck at shallow forever. The distinction might describe a snapshot, not a destiny.

**Expertise in what?** A domain expert (knows medicine, law, finance) uses AI differently than a technical expert (knows systems, architecture, code). A doctor using AI to prototype a patient portal is vibecoding *technically* while applying deep *domain* expertise. The framing conflates these.

**Quality vs. quantity is a false binary.** Some of the most valuable software is simple. The vibecoder's "shallow" app might solve a real problem better than the expert's "deep" system that over-engineers for edge cases that never materialize.

**The fatal flaw:** This framing might flatter experts too much. It assumes expertise cleanly translates to better AI outputs. But experts also bring baggage: over-engineering instincts, attachment to "proper" solutions, inability to accept "good enough." Sometimes the vibecoder's naivety is an advantage—they don't know what's "supposed to be hard" so they just ask for it.

## First-Order Effects

If this idea is true:

1. **The skill premium persists or grows.** Experts remain valuable—not despite AI but because of it. AI amplifies the gap rather than closing it.

2. **Vibecoding becomes a legitimate career path.** People who are skilled at rapidly iterating, testing ideas, and knowing when "good enough" is good enough create real value without ever becoming deep technicians.

3. **Hiring changes.** Companies want two different profiles: rapid prototypers who can explore (vibecoders) and deep builders who can construct (experts). These might be different people.

4. **Learning paths diverge.** Some people optimize for breadth and speed (stay shallow, ship fast). Others optimize for depth (go deep, elevate the tools). Both are rational responses.

5. **The middle hollows out.** Generalist programmers who are "pretty good" at everything but exceptional at nothing may be squeezed. AI handles the generalist work; you need either speed (horizontal) or depth (vertical).

## Second-Order Effects

1. **Experts become editors more than authors.** The expert's job shifts from writing code to curating, correcting, and elevating AI output. This requires different skills than traditional expertise—less "how do I build this?" and more "what's wrong with this and how do I fix it?"

2. **Taste becomes the scarce resource.** Both vibecoders and experts compete on taste—knowing what's worth building, what's good enough, what needs more work. Technical execution becomes cheaper; judgment becomes more valuable.

3. **New illegibility problems.** If experts are elevating AI to produce things they couldn't produce alone, can they still fully explain or debug the output? The expert might be steering a system they don't completely understand. This has implications for critical systems.

4. **Vibecoding creates a new pool of future experts.** Some percentage of today's vibecoders will become tomorrow's deep builders. They'll learn by doing, develop intuitions, and eventually hit walls that force them to go deeper. Vibecoding might be the new on-ramp to expertise.

5. **Expert identity crisis.** If your value was "I can do things others can't," and now AI does those things, what's left? Experts must redefine their value as "I can make AI do things it couldn't do alone." That's a psychological shift, not just a skills shift.

6. **Platform power concentrations.** If vertical expansion requires understanding how to elevate specific models, experts become model-specific. This gives platform providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) power over the expert class. Your expertise is partially locked to their systems.

## The Tension You're Sensing

You're circling the question: **Does AI flatten the skill curve or steepen it?**

The democratization narrative says AI is an equalizer—anyone can build now. The expertise narrative says AI is an amplifier—the skilled pull further ahead.

Your framing suggests both are true simultaneously, but for different people pursuing different strategies. That's the paradox: the same tool is both a floor-raiser and a ceiling-raiser, depending on who holds it and what game they're playing.

The deeper tension: **Is expertise a durable advantage or a temporary one?** If AI keeps improving, does the expert's "vertical expansion" eventually get commoditized too? Are we watching a transition period where expertise still matters, before a future where it doesn't? Or is there something irreducible about human judgment that keeps the vertical game alive indefinitely?

## Adjacent Ideas / Connections

**The Skill Complement Hypothesis.** Economists like David Autor have explored how technology can be a complement to skilled labor rather than just a substitute. AI might substitute for routine expertise while complementing non-routine judgment. This rhymes with your vertical expansion idea.

**Jevons Paradox.** When a resource becomes more efficient to use, total consumption often increases. If AI makes "basic coding" cheaper, demand for coding overall might explode—including demand for the expert-level work that AI enables.

**Shirky's "Publish, then filter" principle.** When publishing costs drop to zero, you publish first and filter later. Vibecoding might be "build, then filter"—lower the cost of building so dramatically that iteration replaces planning. Experts might be the "filters" in this world.

**Dreyfus skill acquisition model.** The journey from novice to expert involves qualitative shifts in how you perceive and interact with a domain. Vibecoding might accelerate early stages but still require traditional paths for later stages.

**The "tool and the hand" relationship.** In craft traditions, masters are distinguished by how they extend their tools' capabilities. A novice uses a chisel; a master makes the chisel do things it wasn't designed for. Same dynamic with AI.

**Cedric Chin's writing on tacit knowledge.** Some expertise is explicit (can be articulated, prompted) and some is tacit (can only be demonstrated). AI might capture explicit expertise but still struggle with tacit knowledge—which is what experts bring when they "elevate" the model.

## Questions Worth Exploring

1. **Inversion:** What if the expert's "vertical expansion" is actually a crutch—a way of justifying old skills rather than developing new ones? Is "elevating the model" just a story experts tell themselves?

2. **Beneficiaries:** Who benefits from the horizontal/vertical framing? Does it serve experts by protecting their status? Does it underestimate vibecoders by calling their output "shallow"?

3. **Historical parallel:** When spreadsheets emerged, did finance experts expand vertically while novices expanded horizontally? What happened to both groups over 40 years?

4. **Edge case:** What about the vibecoder who is an expert in something else—say, a doctor who vibes out a medical app? They're horizontal on the tech axis but vertical on the domain axis. Where do they fit?

5. **Time horizon:** Is vertical expansion a permanent advantage or a temporary one? At what point does model improvement commoditize the expert's contributions?

6. **Measurement:** How would you even measure "horizontal" vs "vertical" expansion? What metrics would demonstrate this distinction empirically?

7. **Transition:** Can you go from horizontal to vertical? What would that path look like? Is vibecoding a stepping stone or a dead end?

## Raw Material

- "AI is a multiplier. What you multiply matters."
- "The vibecoder builds apps. The expert builds capability."
- "Same tool. Radically different leverage."
- "Horizontal expansion is exploration at scale. Vertical expansion is depth at speed."
- "The floor rose. The ceiling rose faster."
- "Expertise isn't replaced by AI—it becomes a force multiplier for it."
- "The middle hollows out: you need either speed or depth."
- Metaphor: AI as a lever. Vibecoders get more levers. Experts get longer levers.
- Metaphor: The master doesn't just use the chisel—they make it do things it wasn't designed for.
- Tension: Is vibecoding a stepping stone to expertise, or a permanent alternative to it?
- Paradox: The same technology is both an equalizer (raises the floor) and an amplifier (raises the ceiling). How can it be both?

## Next Steps

1. **Research the ATM/bank teller dynamic.** When ATMs automated basic transactions, did bank tellers disappear or transform? This is a clean historical analog for the vibecoder/expert distinction—what happened to the "horizontal" tellers vs the "vertical" relationship managers?

2. **Find examples of both paths.** Interview or find case studies of: (a) vibecoders who shipped a lot and what happened to them, (b) experts who used AI to do things previously impossible. Concrete stories make this tangible.

3. **Stress-test the durability question.** Look at previous waves of "expertise obsolescence" predictions. When did expertise persist? When did it get commoditized? What conditions determine which outcome?
