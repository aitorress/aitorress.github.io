This is the dish that taught me pasta water is actually an ingredient, not just something you dump down the drain. Dead simple on paper, humbling in practice.

## Ingredients

- 200g spaghetti or tonnarelli
- 100g Pecorino Romano, finely grated
- 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper (more to taste)
- Salt for pasta water

## Steps

1. Grate the Pecorino Romano finely and set aside in a large bowl.
2. Toast the black pepper in a dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Boil pasta in well-salted water until just shy of al dente.
4. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.
5. Add a splash of pasta water to the Pecorino and whisk to form a paste.
6. Add the hot pasta directly to the bowl with the cheese paste.
7. Toss vigorously, adding pasta water as needed to create a creamy sauce.
8. Serve immediately with extra pepper on top.
