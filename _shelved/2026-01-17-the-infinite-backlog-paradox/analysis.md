# Draft Analysis: The Infinite Backlog Paradox

**Date:** 2026-01-26

---

## Core Idea

The "AI kills engineering jobs" narrative assumes software demand is fixed, but if demand is elastic (infinite backlog), productivity gains mean more gets built, not fewer engineers—and understanding which is true determines the actual future of the profession.

## Piece Type

**Tension-driven** — The piece hinges on a paradox: the same AI productivity gains lead to opposite conclusions depending on an assumption most people don't examine. It challenges both the "mass layoffs" and "nothing changes" camps by exposing the hidden variable.

## What's Working

- **The core framing is sharp.** "Is software a product or infrastructure?" is an excellent crystallization. It gives readers a mental model to hold the whole piece.
- **Steel Man section is genuinely strong.** The "backlog is fake" argument, Jevons Paradox limits, and "capital follows returns, not capacity" are real objections that the optimistic view needs to address.
- **Devil's Advocate lands counterblows.** The "80/20 is a lie" reversal and "look at history" arguments provide real tension.
- **Second-order effects are interesting.** "Technical debt becomes unacceptable," "startups get more dangerous," and "geographic arbitrage ends" are non-obvious and provocative.
- **Raw Material has quotable lines.** "The backlog isn't a queue—it's a graveyard" and "Software is infrastructure, not product" are punchy.
- **Adjacent Ideas section shows intellectual grounding.** Jevons Paradox, David Autor, Marc Andreessen, Clayton Christensen, Fred Brooks, Solow Paradox—these are the right references.

## Gaps to Fill

### Needs Research

1. **Historical employment data post-productivity-tools** — The piece asserts "every productivity tool in history was supposed to reduce jobs" but doesn't provide evidence. Need data on:
   - Accounting employment after spreadsheets (1980s-2000s)
   - Graphic design employment after Adobe (1990s-2010s)
   - Manufacturing employment after automation (various periods)
   - Bank teller employment after ATMs (1970s-2000s)

2. **Jevons Paradox specifics** — The coal example is mentioned but not developed. Need the actual data: how much did coal consumption increase after efficiency improvements? This strengthens the analogy.

3. **Current engineering utilization rates** — The piece asks "what's the actual utilization rate of engineering capacity?" but doesn't answer. Are there studies on how engineers spend their time (building vs. meetings vs. maintenance)?

4. **AI productivity distribution** — Question 3 asks "Is AI productivity gains uniform or concentrated?" This is answerable with emerging research (BCG study, etc.). Does AI help 10x engineers more or level the playing field?

### Needs Author Input

1. **Where do you actually land?** — The draft presents both sides well but doesn't commit. Is the "infinite demand" thesis your position, or are you genuinely uncertain? The piece needs a stance, even if qualified.

2. **Do you have personal experience with "fake backlogs"?** — The argument that most backlog items are "political theater" is strong but abstract. Do you have a story from your own work where the backlog was revealed as fake vs. where it was genuinely elastic?

3. **What's your take on the "missing rung" problem?** — The piece raises the question of where future senior engineers come from if juniors are displaced. Do you have a view on this? It's an important unresolved tension.

4. **Who's the audience?** — Is this for engineers worried about their jobs? For managers making headcount decisions? For investors betting on the sector? The framing might shift depending on who you're talking to.

### Needs More Thinking

1. **The "both could be true" resolution feels underdeveloped.** — Question 7 raises "fewer engineers in big companies, more in startups"—this is interesting but hand-wavy. If this is the actual answer, it deserves more than a question.

2. **The political economy angle is underexplored.** — Who benefits if productivity gains go to shareholders vs. workers? The piece mentions this in Questions but doesn't integrate it into the argument. This could be a strong second-order effect section.

3. **Timeframe ambiguity.** — "Infinite demand" might be true over 20 years but irrelevant over 2 years. The piece doesn't address the short-term vs. long-term distinction, which is where most of the practical stakes lie.

## Consider Cutting

- **The full "Adjacent Ideas" section** — These references are useful for research but probably won't all survive into the final piece. Pick 2-3 that do the most work.
- **Some of the "Questions Worth Exploring"** — Seven questions is too many to leave hanging. Either answer them or cut them. Questions 4, 5, and 7 are the strongest.
- **The "Next Steps" section** — This is workflow for the author, not content for readers.
- **Redundancy between Steel Man and Devil's Advocate** — Some points appear in both with slight variations. Tighten.

## Recommended Next Step

**Run /draft-research first** on:
1. Historical employment data (spreadsheets, ATMs, automation)
2. Jevons Paradox specifics
3. AI productivity distribution research (BCG study, Mollick's work)

Then **run /draft-input** to get the author's position and personal experience.

The research will determine whether the historical evidence actually supports the "infinite demand" thesis, which is load-bearing for the piece.
