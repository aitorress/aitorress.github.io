The skills that make you resilient to AI disruption are exactly the skills that AI makes easy to skip.

That's the paradox I keep circling. To use AI well, you need judgment, taste, and deep expertise. But AI makes it trivially easy to skip the struggle that builds those things. The tool that could make you better makes it harder to become good in the first place.

My kids haven't asked me what they should study yet. When they do, I want to have something better than "study whatever makes you happy" — which is what I'd say now, and it's a confession of uncertainty, not wisdom.

Here's what I do know: that uncertainty isn't distributed evenly.

## The Burden Falls on the Wrong People

Mid-career professionals have something hard to automate: tacit knowledge, judgment, context. A senior engineer doesn't just know how to code. She knows which problems are worth solving, how decisions actually get made, why certain elegant approaches fail in practice. This judgment layer sits on years of experience. It's exactly what current AI lacks.

The real uncertainty burden falls on people entering the workforce. [Adoption lag](/2026/01/19/the-unbundling-of-work/) will protect established professionals — they'll adapt, pivot, or retire before AI fully reshapes their industries. New entrants don't have that buffer. And by extension, neither do the kids we're trying to prepare.

## I've Seen This at Work

When engineers are reward-hacking for ticket completion, you can tell. The code gets merged, the metrics look good, but the quality is poor. You know AI was involved because no human who understood the system would have made those choices.

The downstream effect is worse than the bad code. Senior engineers spend their time reviewing and fixing instead of building. This makes them skeptical of AI. They've seen what happens when people who don't understand the work use tools that don't understand it either.

The spiral: juniors misuse AI, seniors clean up, seniors become skeptical, adoption slows, and the juniors still aren't building fundamentals. Everyone loses.

A [Harvard/BCG study](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=64700) found the same pattern in controlled conditions: when tasks fell outside AI's capability boundary, novices did *worse* with AI than without it — a 19-percentage-point performance drop. Experts succeeded by recognizing flawed suggestions and rejecting them. AI is most useful to the people who need it least.

The calculator came after the multiplication tables. AI came before the fundamentals.

## The Honest Position Is Uncertainty

I should acknowledge the counterargument: maybe "fundamentals first" is a historical assumption, not a necessary one. A generation fluent in AI from childhood might develop different kinds of judgment. We worried calculators would erode mathematical intuition. Maybe they did. Maybe it didn't matter.

But I keep coming back to GPS. People lost the ability to navigate without it. Fine until it isn't — dead zones, failures, moments when you need the skill you never built. The question is whether AI dependency follows that pattern, or whether the stakes are higher.

## What I'll Tell My Kids

So what will I actually say when my kids ask about careers?

Study whatever makes you happy. I'll mean it. But also: build something worth multiplying. Develop taste. Go deep somewhere. Learn what good looks like before you let the tools take over.

The paradox I opened with doesn't resolve neatly. I can't tell them to avoid AI, and I can't tell them to embrace it uncritically. So I'm preparing them for uncertainty itself. That's the only honest answer I've got.
