# Scarcity as a Currency

Scarcity has always been the organizing principle of value. What’s scarce becomes valuable - whether it’s resources, access, or expertise. From an instinct perspective, humans are drawn to status, and status has long been tied to scarcity.

For most of history, **intelligence was scarce.** You needed years of training to become a doctor, judge, or engineer.  Institutions became the middlemen of scarcity: schools hoarded knowledge, courts interpreted it, bureaucracies rationed it. Hiring and training experts was expensive, so institutions emphasized hierarchy and gatekeeping - who got access to intelligence, and when. Scarcity of intelligence created status hierarchies: elite schools, specialist doctors, top engineers. People built their careers around being the _scarce one_ in a domain.

But AI collapses knowledge scarcity. The democratization of intelligence through AI dilutes traditional knowledge-based advantages. If 80% of “smartness” is available for $20 a month, then raw knowledge is no longer a differentiator. Intelligence is now cheap and abundant - not perfect, not universal, but accessible at scale in ways that challenge the design of our institutions. A school isn’t just competing with another school; it’s competing with a world where anyone can summon a personalized tutor instantly. Hospitals aren’t just competing with hospitals; patients can consult an AI diagnostician before ever walking in the door.

So we face the defining question: **when the marginal cost of creating and obtaining information falls to zero, how do humans remain scarce - and therefore valuable - in an age of abundant intelligence?**
        
# When The Gatekeepers Break

For centuries, “the smartest” meant knowing the most. Intelligence was measured in memory: how much you could hoard, recall, and recite.

Institutions fed this model: schools stuffed students with information, filtered out the ones who couldn’t keep up, and stamped the survivors with credentials. Scarcity made official.

And those credentials weren’t free. You paid, often for years. Institutions competed to be the most elite, the most scarce, the highest status. The scarcer the credential, the more valuable it became and the more they could charge for it.

But AI broke the game. Knowledge is no longer scarce; it’s democratized. The credentials may still be locked up, but the knowledge behind them is cheap, abundant, and everywhere.

**The credential still costs six figures. The knowledge is twenty bucks a month. Guess which one breaks first.**

# The Scarcity Flywheel

Curation is the art of distilling information until it becomes a coherent part of your identity. Curation is taste. And taste is identity. It’s not just “sharing links,” it’s making sense of the flood of data in a way that’s memorable and aligned with your worldview. At its core, curation is **judgment contextualized through lived experience.**

AI can’t do this. By design, it’s factual, median, safe. It avoids boldness, bias, and edge. That means everyone gets the same “smart but generic” answers. The scarce good is no longer the information itself, but **the perspective** - the way a human reframes or re-contextualizes it. Curation isn’t neutral; it carries identity. People don’t just want information that’s coherent with _a_ worldview - they want information that’s coherent with _your_ worldview.

Rick Rubin says "Information doesn't enter the vessel directly... It is filtered in a unique way for each of us". Two people curating recipes would create completely different collections. One sees health and macros, the other sees comfort and family. Same ingredients, totally different lens. Their lived experience shapes what they notice, what they emphasize, what connections they draw. That’s not knowledge-dumping. That’s individuality made visible.

**Curated opinions are directly opposed to algorithms that just predict the next most probable token.**

Curation isn’t enough. Without *signal*, it’s just hoarding. Signal is how you package your perspective - writing, building, teaching, posting, talking. It’s how your judgment becomes visible. AI can generate infinite content, but human signals carry style, risk, and skin in the game. Signal also becomes material of curations for other people.

Signals, repeated over time, create **trust.** Not the algorithmic “reliability” of a machine, but human trust: the willingness to vouch for someone’s judgment. Trust follows a simple formula:

**Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) ÷ Self-Orientation**

AI can simulate credibility and reliability. What it can’t fake is intimacy or self-orientation. It has no skin in the game. Humans do. That’s why trust compounds around people who consistently stake their reputation on what they curate and signal. They become **trust nodes** - anchors in the noise, the ones whose judgment others rely on. And here’s the key: it doesn’t matter who you impact. A leader or influencer may shape millions, while you might choose to focus on friends, colleagues, or family. The circles are different in size, but the dynamic is identical. Wherever trust takes root, networks form. Those networks feed back through interactions, curations, and reinforcement—until the effect multiplies. That’s where **1 + 1 = 3**: trust compounds not because of scale, but because every relationship magnifies the signal.

And here’s the kicker: these traits don’t live in isolation. They feed each other. Curation → Signal → Trust → Stronger Curation. The more you curate, the clearer your signal. The clearer your signal, the deeper the trust. The deeper the trust, the sharper the feedback you receive - which makes your curation even better.

It’s a flywheel. And in a world of infinite noise, only scarcity compounds: **curation, signal, and trust.**


# The Human Edge


The traits that used to be “soft skills” - taste, perspective, trust - just became the hard currency of relevance.

Traditional career advice is backwards. You don’t win by being well-rounded anymore. You win by being more intensely yourself. Your quirks and obsessions are no longer weaknesses. They’re features. The most valuable people will be “intellectual wanderers,” connecting dots across domains and filtering abundance through their unique lens.

**AI makes human limitations valuable.**

Our biases, our particular angles, our inability to be purely objective - these become our competitive advantages in a world of abundant information.**

For institutions, the role is shifting. Standardization and credentialing still matter - nobody wants a surgeon without one. But they’re table stakes, not differentiators. What schools, companies, and governments need to cultivate now is judgment, creativity, and trust. Authority will matter less; resonance will matter more.

And that’s the real point: **AI doesn’t erase the need for humans. It elevates it. The more machines flood the world with knowledge, the more valuable distinctly human judgment becomes.**

It’s tempting to think AI makes humans obsolete. Know everything, do everything - what’s left for us? But that’s the wrong frame.

Here’s the paradox: as machines gain terrain, our limitations - bias, judgment, our need for connection - become our absolute advantage. AI can flood the world with answers. But only humans - fallible, opinionated, unpredictable humans - can turn that into meaning, stake a reputation on it, and earn real trust.

AI can imitate curation and mimic style. But it can’t replicate lived experience, skin-in-the-game intimacy, or the messy goodness of human fallibility. The future isn’t less human. It’s more. AI doesn’t erase what we bring. It makes the human edge sharper.
