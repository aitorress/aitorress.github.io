# Still Handy

[Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/03/1072589/video-geoffrey-hinton-google-ai-risk-ethics/), one of the architects of deep learning, said something a few years ago that I keep coming back to: "I think it's quite conceivable that humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence."

*Passing phase.*

The quote circulates in AI discourse like a warning label. Most people read it as doom. I'm not sure that's right.

When this quote makes the rounds—on Twitter threads, in tech podcasts, at dinner parties where someone's had too much wine—the interpretation is always the same. AI replaces us. We become obsolete. Skynet, but with better marketing. The story writes itself: superintelligence arrives, decides we're either a threat or an inconvenience, and that's that. Humanity had a good run.

It's a clean narrative. Terrifying, but clean. And it's not how I took it.

Look at the word he used: *conceivable*. Not inevitable. Not likely. Not even probable. Conceivable. He was answering a question about worst-case scenarios at a conference, and his fuller explanation is worth reading: "You need biological intelligence to evolve so that it can create digital intelligence."

We're not the thing being replaced. We're the origin. The necessary precondition. The quote that sounds like a death sentence is actually a birth announcement—we're the species that creates what comes next.

But here's what really caught me: "passing phase" assumes we know what comes after. The phrase implies we stop existing—that there's a clean break between us and whatever follows. But evolution doesn't work by replacement. It works by becoming. What if we're not passing *out* of existence, but passing *into* something?

Look at our ancestors. Scientists named the earliest recognizable humans *Homo habilis*—literally "handy man." We defined ourselves by our tools from the start. And each major chapter in human evolution has been a story of new tool-relationships: *habilis* with stone tools, *erectus* with fire and cooperative hunting, *sapiens* with language and writing and eventually computers. Each transition wasn't one species replacing another. It was the next version of what it means to be human. Each was a "passing phase" into something more.

So when I hear "humanity is a passing phase," I don't hear extinction. I hear the same pattern that's been running for 2.6 million years. We pick up a new tool. We change. We become something we couldn't have imagined before.

The philosopher Andy Clark [calls it](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/the-mind-at-work--andy-clark-on-our-brain-s-endless-entanglement) "ongoing cyborgification"—the way we've always extended ourselves through our tools. A notebook becomes part of your memory. A calculator becomes part of your reasoning. The boundary between "you" and "your tools" has never been as clean as we pretend. We've been cyborgs since the first human picked up a rock and realized it could do what fingernails couldn't.

AI extends... what, exactly? Maybe everything. Maybe that's what makes it feel different. But different in degree isn't different in kind.

I use these tools every day. The difference between wielding AI and not wielding it is orders of magnitude—in speed, in reach, in what I can even attempt. But here's the thing: the tool isn't magic. It's a tool. And tools need someone who knows where they work and where they don't.

Ethan Mollick calls this the "[jagged frontier](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged)." AI capabilities aren't a smooth line where hard tasks are out of reach and easy ones are handled. The frontier is jagged: AI crushes some complex tasks while failing at seemingly simple ones. [A study](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=64700) with Boston Consulting Group consultants found 40% quality improvement on tasks inside the frontier—but 19% *worse* performance on tasks outside it. The skill isn't just using the tool. It's knowing which side of the line you're on.

This is what tool-mastery has always looked like. Every human ancestor who picked up a new tool had to learn its edges. Where does the stone cut? Where does it shatter? Where does fire cook, and where does it consume? The practice is the same now: I'm learning where AI extends me and where it misleads me. Pushing the boundaries of the tool, and pushing my own.

Maybe Hinton is right. Maybe we are a passing phase. But that's not news—we've always been passing into what comes next. The question isn't whether we're a phase. It's whether we're paying attention to the transition.

"Passing phase" sounds like an ending. It might just be what Homo has always done: pick up a new tool and become something more. We're still handy. We're still becoming.
