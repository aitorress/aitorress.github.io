Prioritized revision items, highest ROI first:

## 1. Restructure the opening — lead with strength, not uncertainty
**Status:** completed

- **Issue:** Both critics flag the opening. Galloway: "Your lede is a confession of ignorance." Housel: The paradox should organize the piece but it's buried. Currently you start with "I don't know" and end with a shrug.
- **Why it matters:** Readers decide in the first paragraph whether to trust you. Starting with confusion signals you have nothing to say. Your strongest insights are hidden in the middle.
- **Suggested fix:** Open with the paradox ("The skills that make you resilient to AI are exactly the skills AI makes easy to skip") or the Harvard study bombshell (19-point performance drop for novices). Save the confession of uncertainty for later, as earned humility after demonstrating insight.
- **Questions to resolve:** Which hook is stronger for your intended audience — the paradox (more conceptual) or the Harvard data (more concrete)? Do you want to lead with fear or with a puzzle?

## 2. Cut scope — the piece tries to cover too much ground
**Status:** completed (via transitions, not cuts)

- **Issue:** Both critics say the same thing differently. Galloway: "The steelman section is too long." Housel: "The piece works too hard to cover every angle... Each idea is interesting. Together, they dilute."
- **Why it matters:** Reader attention is finite. Every section that isn't building toward your core insight is stealing oxygen from it. The piece currently covers: multipliers, adoption lags, calculator analogy, Harvard study, AGI timelines, workplace spirals, career advice. That's 7 threads.
- **Suggested fix:** Pick 2-3 threads maximum. The paradox + the Harvard study + one vivid example (workplace spiral OR calculator analogy, not both). Cut or drastically shorten everything else.
- **Questions to resolve:** Which threads are load-bearing for your argument? What can you delete entirely vs. compress into a single sentence? Is the steelman section earning its length?

## 3. Replace "study whatever makes you happy" with something concrete
**Status:** completed

- **Issue:** Both critics reject this framing. Galloway: "That's not advice, that's surrender... What are you ACTUALLY doing with your kids?" Housel: "That's also what everyone says."
- **Why it matters:** This is your ending. It's what readers remember. Currently it undercuts all the sharp thinking that came before. You've diagnosed a hard problem, then offered a platitude.
- **Suggested fix:** Either (a) get specific about what you're actually doing differently with your own kids, or (b) let the paradox stand unanswered — end with the question, not a false resolution.
- **Questions to resolve:** What ARE you doing with your kids? Are you willing to share that? If not, would you rather end on honest uncertainty ("I don't know, and maybe that's the point") than fake resolution?

## 4. Add a concrete story to the workplace spiral section
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Housel specifically: "There's a story missing... we don't see a face, a moment, a specific failure." Galloway implicitly: "The multiplier section needs an example with stakes."
- **Why it matters:** Abstract analysis doesn't stick. A single vivid scene of a junior engineer failing with AI would make the spiral feel real and memorable.
- **Suggested fix:** Write a 2-3 paragraph scene. One junior, one task, one failure. Anonymize if needed, but keep it specific enough to feel true.
- **Questions to resolve:** Do you have a specific incident you can draw from? Can you anonymize sufficiently while keeping the detail? Would a composite be honest enough?

## 5. Move the Harvard study higher and use it as evidence
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Galloway: "A 19-percentage-point performance DROP... that's not an aside, that's the lede."
- **Why it matters:** This is your strongest empirical backing. It proves your thesis that AI harms novices. Currently it appears mid-piece where readers might skim past.
- **Suggested fix:** Either open with it (as suggested in #1) or bring it in immediately after stating the paradox as your first piece of evidence.
- **Questions to resolve:** Does the study need more context to land? Should you quote the specific numbers or summarize the finding?

## 6. Strengthen the ending — commit or question, don't shrug
**Status:** completed

- **Issue:** Galloway: "That's a shrug ending dressed as a Gretzky quote. What's the one thing you'd bet on?" Housel: "The real essay might end with the question, not the answer."
- **Why it matters:** Endings determine whether readers share, remember, or act. The current ending dissipates energy instead of focusing it.
- **Suggested fix:** Two options: (a) Galloway-style — make a concrete bet, something you'd stake reputation on; (b) Housel-style — restate the paradox and let it hang, trusting the reader to sit with discomfort.
- **Questions to resolve:** Which ending feels more true to you? Are you willing to commit to a position you might be wrong about? Or is the honest answer that you genuinely don't know?
