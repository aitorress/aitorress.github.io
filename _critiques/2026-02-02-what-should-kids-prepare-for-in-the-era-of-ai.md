## Editorial Critique: What Should Kids Prepare For in the Era of AI?

---

### Scott Galloway's Review

**Overall:** This is smart and you clearly know your stuff, but you're being too damn polite about it. You've got important things to say about kids getting screwed by forces beyond their control, and you're wrapping it in so much uncertainty it reads like a shrug emoji. "Study whatever makes you happy" is the opening and the conclusion—that's not advice, that's surrender. The piece has real teeth in the middle (the calculator analogy, the Harvard study, the spiral with juniors and seniors) but you keep filing them down with hedges. You're writing for worried parents who want help. Help them.

**Specific notes:**

1. **Your lede is a confession of ignorance** — You literally say "I used to have opinions... now I don't know." Lead with what you DO know. The burden falls unevenly on new entrants. That's your insight. Start there.

2. **The Harvard study is buried** — A 19-percentage-point performance DROP. That's not an aside, that's the lede. "AI actively harms people who don't already have expertise" is a bombshell. Put it higher.

3. **"Study whatever makes you happy" is lazy** — You admit it's a confession, then say it anyway at the end. What are you ACTUALLY doing with your kids? What's the concrete plan? Tutors? Restrictions on AI tools? Specific skills you're prioritizing? Give me something I can steal.

4. **Where are the numbers on the career disruption?** — You cite Amodei and Hassabis on AGI timelines but nothing on which careers are actually dying. Stock photography is "dying"—how much? Generic illustration—what's the revenue drop? You're a data person. Show it.

5. **The steelman section is too long** — You spend 4 paragraphs undermining your own argument. That's not intellectual honesty, that's hedging. Pick one counterargument and dispatch it, then move on.

6. **"The puck is moving faster than anyone can track"** — That's a shrug ending dressed as a Gretzky quote. What's the one thing you'd bet on? Commit.

**What would make this great:** Stop confessing uncertainty and start telling parents what you're actually doing differently because of what you know.

### Morgan Housel's Review

**Overall:** There's genuine thinking here, and it's struggling to get out. The piece is trying to be comprehensive when it might be better as an essay about a single paradox: the skills that make you resilient to AI are exactly the skills AI makes easy to skip. That's a beautiful tension. You name it directly in the conclusion, but by then you've already spent the reader's attention on multipliers, adoption lags, calculator analogies, Harvard studies, and AGI timelines. Each is interesting. Together, they dilute. The piece would haunt me more if it stayed with one image longer.

**Specific notes:**

1. **The "multiplier" metaphor is good but moves too fast** — The power saw image is vivid. But what if you spent a full section there? A story about a specific novice being "dangerous" with AI, not the abstract spiral you describe later? The reader needs to feel it.

2. **"The calculator came after the multiplication tables"** — This is quietly devastating. It's doing enormous work in one line. What if this framing organized the whole piece instead of appearing as one section among many?

3. **The catch-22 deserves more discomfort** — You state the paradox cleanly ("they don't yet have anything for AI to multiply") and then immediately move to solutions. What if you let that sit? Let the reader feel trapped before you offer a way out?

4. **There's a story missing** — You mention watching engineers reward-hack for ticket completion. That's vivid workplace observation. But we don't see a face, a moment, a specific failure. The abstraction protects you (and them), but it costs the reader connection.

5. **The ending resolves too quickly** — "Preparing them for uncertainty itself" is wise, but it's also what everyone says. The real essay might end with the question, not the answer. What if the last line was the paradox restated, unanswered?

6. **"I've seen this at work"** — That section title suggests a story. The section is analysis. There's a richer essay where you show the spiral through a single junior engineer's arc over six months.

**What would make this resonate longer:** Trust the paradox enough to let it stay uncomfortable instead of resolving into "study whatever makes you happy."

### What Both Would Praise

**Scott Galloway's praise:**
- **The spiral dynamic** (juniors misuse AI → seniors clean up → seniors get skeptical → adoption slows) — This is original observation from inside a company. It's not theoretical. More of this.
- **"AI is most useful to the people who need it least"** — That's a killer line. Punchy, true, and slightly uncomfortable. It belongs higher in the piece.
- **The Harvard study citation** — You actually brought data. 758 consultants, specific percentages. This is how you earn trust. Now do it for the career claims too.

**Morgan Housel's praise:**
- **"The calculator came after the multiplication tables. AI came before the fundamentals."** — This is compression at its best. One comparison doing the work of a whole argument. It's the kind of line readers will remember and repeat.
- **The acknowledgment that his advice is a confession** — This is honest in a way most parenting-meets-career writing isn't. There's vulnerability here that makes the uncertainty feel human rather than evasive.
- **"The skills that make you resilient to AI disruption are exactly the skills that AI makes easy to skip."** — This is the essay's soul. It's the idea worth trusting completely.

### Summary

| Galloway would say | Housel would say |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Lead with the Harvard study, not your confusion | Lead with the paradox and stay with it |
| Cut the steelman section in half | Let the catch-22 section breathe longer |
| Tell us what you're actually doing with your kids | Tell us about one specific junior engineer |
| More data on dying careers | More story, less coverage |
| Commit to a position in the ending | Let the question linger in the ending |
| The "multiplier" section needs an example with stakes | The "multiplier" section needs a scene |

**Where they agree:** The piece has a strong core insight (the paradox) that gets diluted by trying to cover too much ground. Both would say: pick fewer ideas and go deeper. Both notice that "study whatever makes you happy" is a weak frame that undercuts the sharper thinking inside.
