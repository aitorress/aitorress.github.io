Hey - welcome to my corner of the internet! I write short, opinionated notes about AI, product, and operating frameworks, mixed with the occasional strong take on design, strategy, or whatever’s currently stuck in my head.

I collect frameworks, strong opinions, and good stories — then test them out in real life. This blog is where I share the keepers, the flops, hoping they lead to insights and good conversations.

If something here sparks an idea, a debate, or even a “you’re wrong and here’s why,” I’d love to hear from you. You can reach me on LinkedIn or X — or just leave a comment on a post.
