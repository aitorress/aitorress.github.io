Hey — welcome to my corner of the internet! I write short, opinionated notes about AI, product, and operating frameworks, mixed with the occasional strong take on design, strategy, or whatever’s currently stuck in my head.

If something here sparks an idea, a debate, or even a “you’re wrong and here’s why,” I’d love to hear from you. You can reach me on LinkedIn or X — or just leave a comment on a post.
