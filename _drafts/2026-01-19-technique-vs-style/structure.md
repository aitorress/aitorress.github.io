# Proposed Structure: Technique vs Style

**Date:** 2026-01-22
**Status:** Awaiting approval

## Core Argument
Style is the residue of choices—and choice requires capability. Without technique, what looks like style is just the shape of your limitations.

## Piece Type
**Tension-driven** — Challenges the belief that authentic self-expression is separate from technical mastery.

## Proposed Outline

### 1. The Sharp Distinction (Opening)
**Purpose:** Open with the core insight immediately. No throat-clearing.
**Content:** "The amateur who can't draw hands and the master who chooses to abstract them are doing fundamentally different things—even if the output looks similar." Lead with the vocabulary metaphor: technique is vocabulary, style is what you choose to say.
**Estimated length:** Short — 2-3 paragraphs
**Source:** Draft (The Seed, Raw Material)

*Note: This avoids the typical "casual opening → pivot to stakes" pattern. Start sharp.*

---

### 2. The Logic
**Purpose:** Build the argument step by step.
**Content:** Style requires choice → choice requires options → options require capability → capability requires technique. Picasso could render photorealistic portraits before he dismantled the form. The Ramones knew how to play; they chose not to. Hemingway's sparse prose came after learning to write complex sentences.
**Estimated length:** Medium — 3-4 paragraphs
**Source:** Draft (Steel Man)

---

### 3. "My Style Is All I Can Do" (Personal Anchor)
**Purpose:** Ground the abstract in lived experience.
**Content:** Author's jazz guitar experience. Hearing ideas you can't execute because they're not in muscle memory. In flow, those ideas never come—because they're not options. "My style is pretty much all I can do, but I know if I keep expanding, I'll be able to pick and choose." That's when it becomes real style.
**Estimated length:** Medium — 2-3 paragraphs
**Source:** Author input

*This is the emotional center. The piece should feel like the author has lived this.*

---

### 4. The Counterargument: But What About Outsider Art?
**Purpose:** Engage the strongest objection head-on.
**Content:** Dubuffet, Art Brut, the argument that some great art came from people who didn't know the rules. Acknowledge this looks like it disproves the thesis.
**Estimated length:** Short — 2 paragraphs
**Source:** Draft (Devil's Advocate), Research

---

### 5. The Flip: Outsider Art Proves the Point
**Purpose:** Turn the counterargument into support.
**Content:** Dubuffet opposed *institutional* technique, not capability itself. Darger and Wölfli developed sophisticated techniques through decades of obsessive practice—just outside institutions. They had style *because* they built capability. The distinction isn't trained vs. untrained—it's capable of choice vs. stuck.
**Estimated length:** Medium — 3 paragraphs
**Source:** Research (outsider-art-art-brut.md), Author decision

---

### 6. The Gatekeeping Question
**Purpose:** Defuse the "this is just elitism" objection.
**Content:** Credentials gatekeep, not capability. Portfolio over pedigree. Institutions don't get to define what counts as technique—but that doesn't mean technique doesn't matter. The question isn't "who certified you?" but "can you do something other than what you're doing?"
**Estimated length:** Short — 2 paragraphs
**Source:** Author input (gatekeeping position)

---

### 7. The Test (How Do You Know?)
**Purpose:** Give readers something actionable.
**Content:** How do you tell if it's style or limitation? From the outside, you often can't. From the inside: try something else. If you can't—or if you've never tried—what you call "style" might be the shape of your cage. Some "styles" dissolve the moment you learn the thing you were avoiding.
**Estimated length:** Short — 2 paragraphs
**Source:** Draft (First-Order Effects #3)

---

### 8. The Close
**Purpose:** Land the piece without oversimplifying.
**Content:** This isn't about earning permission to create. It's about knowing the difference between freedom and accident. Learn the rules so you can break them intentionally. Your authentic voice might be waiting on the other side of technique—or it might be what you discover you'd choose anyway, once you have the choice.
**Estimated length:** Short — 1-2 paragraphs
**Source:** Author input (purpose of the piece)

*Note: Avoid a stark binary close ("Do X or suffer Y"). This piece earns a more nuanced landing.*

## What's Not Included

| Material | Reason for cutting |
|----------|-------------------|
| Prodigies flame out | Tangent—doesn't advance core argument |
| Beginner's luck problem | Tangent |
| AI art angle | Interesting but dilutes focus; save for another piece |
| Minimalism's dirty secret | Good observation but the piece is already long |
| Dreyfus model, wabi-sabi, Ericsson | Adjacent ideas overload—pick jazz inside/outside only if needed |
| Most "Questions Worth Exploring" | Draft scaffolding, not article content |
| "Does the audience care?" | The piece isn't about audience reception |

---

## Open Questions (Pre-Approval)

1. **Include the AI angle?** It's timely and "AI has infinite style and zero technique" is sharp. But it might be a distraction.

2. **How much jazz inside/outside?** The draft mentions it. Could strengthen the jazz guitar section, or could be cut.

3. **Title?** "Technique vs Style: The Craft You Can't Fake" works, but alternatives:
   - "Style Is the Residue of Choices"
   - "The Craft You Can't Fake"
   - "Your Style Might Just Be Your Cage"

---

## Alternative Structures Considered

**Option B: Open with personal experience**
Start with the jazz guitar frustration, then zoom out to the principle. More personal but risks burying the sharp insight.

**Option C: Dialectical structure**
Present the "technique doesn't matter" case first, then dismantle it. More academic, less the author's voice.

**Recommended: Option A** (above) — leads with the insight, grounds in experience, addresses objections, lands clean.
