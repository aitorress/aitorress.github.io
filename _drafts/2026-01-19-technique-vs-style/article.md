# Style Is the Residue of Choices

The amateur who can't draw hands and the master who chooses to abstract them are doing fundamentally different things. The output might look similar. But one is constrained by inability, and the other is making a choice from a position of capability.

This distinction matters more than we like to admit. Style is the residue of choices. To have a choice, you need options. To have options, you need capability. Without that capability, what you call "style" is just the shape of your limitations.

Think of it this way: technique is vocabulary, and style is what you choose to say. If you only know fifty words, you're not making a stylistic choice to write simply. You just don't know any others. The writer with a ten-thousand-word vocabulary who writes in plain language is doing something different from the writer who never learned the bigger words. Same output, different act.

Follow the chain. Style requires choice. Choice requires options. Options require capability. And capability requires technique.

This isn't abstract philosophy. You can trace it in specific artists. Picasso could render photorealistic portraits before he started dismantling the human form. His cubist faces weren't the result of not knowing how to draw. They were a deliberate departure from mastery he'd already demonstrated. The Ramones knew how to play their instruments. They chose three chords and two minutes because that's what the music demanded, not because they couldn't do anything else. Hemingway's spare prose came after years of journalism and revision. He learned to write complex sentences before he decided to strip them down.

The pattern holds across domains. The chef who serves a "simple" dish of three ingredients isn't hiding behind simplicity. They're making a choice that only works if each ingredient is perfect and the technique is invisible. The comedian who tells a one-liner in ten words cut it down from fifty. Brevity looks easy. It isn't.

The strongest version of this argument: technique creates the space for style to emerge. Without it, what you call "style" is just the shape of your current constraints. It's like calling a cage a room because you've never walked outside.

I know this because I live it. I play jazz guitar, and I'm not good enough. I can hear ideas in my head that I can't execute because I haven't practiced enough, because I haven't broken through the barrier. In a state of flow, those ideas never even come. They're not part of my muscle memory or repertoire, so my brain doesn't offer them as options.

Right now, my style is pretty much all I can do. But I know that if I keep working, keep expanding what's possible, I'll eventually be able to pick and choose. That's when I'll really have a style. Not because I'll play differently, but because I'll be choosing to play this way instead of being stuck with it.

In complex domains like jazz, everyone feels caged at different points. The question isn't whether you have limitations. It's whether you know the difference between a wall you've chosen and a wall you can't see past.
