# Style Is the Residue of Choices

The amateur who can't draw hands and the master who chooses to abstract them are doing fundamentally different things. The output might look similar. But one is constrained by inability, and the other is making a choice from a position of capability.

Style is the residue of choices. To have a choice, you need options. To have options, you need capability. Without that capability, what you call "style" is just the shape of your limitations.

Technique is vocabulary, and style is what you choose to say. If you only know fifty words, you're not making a stylistic choice to write simply. You just don't know any others. The writer with a ten-thousand-word vocabulary who writes in plain language is doing something different from the writer who never learned the bigger words. Same output, different act.

Follow the chain. Style requires choice. Choice requires options. Options require capability. And capability requires technique.

You can trace this in specific artists. Picasso could render photorealistic portraits before he started dismantling the human form. His cubist faces were a deliberate departure from mastery he'd already demonstrated. The Ramones knew how to play their instruments. They chose three chords and two minutes because that's what the music demanded, not because they couldn't do anything else. Hemingway's spare prose came after years of journalism and revision. He learned to write complex sentences before he decided to strip them down.

The chef who serves a "simple" dish of three ingredients isn't hiding behind simplicity. They're making a choice that only works if each ingredient is perfect and the technique is invisible. The comedian who tells a one-liner in ten words cut it down from fifty. Brevity looks easy. It isn't.

Technique creates the space for style to emerge. Without it, what you call "style" is just the shape of your current constraints. It's like calling a cage a room because you've never walked outside.

I know this because I live it. I play jazz guitar, and I'm not good enough. I can hear ideas in my head that I can't execute because I haven't practiced enough, because I haven't broken through the barrier. In a state of flow, those ideas never even come. They're not part of my muscle memory or repertoire, so my brain doesn't offer them as options.

Right now, my style is all I can do. But I know that if I keep working, keep expanding what's possible, I'll eventually be able to pick and choose. That's when I'll really have a style. Not because I'll play differently, but because I'll be choosing it.

In jazz, everyone feels caged at different points. The issue isn't whether you have limitations. It's whether you know the difference between a wall you've chosen and a wall you can't see past.

But here's where the argument gets uncomfortable. Some of the most important art came from people who didn't know the rules. Outsider art. Punk rock. Folk traditions. Henri Rousseau never went to art school. Grandma Moses started painting at 78. Jean Dubuffet championed what he called "Art Brut" (raw art): work by psychiatric patients, hermits, and self-taught creators with no exposure to mainstream artistic culture. He believed that academic training corrupted authentic expression.

This looks like a fatal counterexample. If technique enables style, how do you explain artists who had style without any formal technique at all?

Look closer. Dubuffet wasn't arguing that technique doesn't matter. He was arguing that *institutional* technique corrupts authentic expression. That's a different claim. He opposed the academic cooking process: art schools, galleries, museums. He didn't oppose capability itself.

And the famous outsider artists? They had technique. Just not academic technique. Henry Darger spent decades developing systematic methods: tracing, collage, modified enlargements. Adolf Wölfli produced 25,000 densely worked pages over 35 years, with "careful gradations of color and intricate pattern." These artists had style *because* they built capability through obsessive practice. They just built it outside institutions.

The distinction isn't trained versus untrained. It's capable of choice versus stuck. The question isn't "who certified you?" It's "can you do something other than what you're doing?"

This raises a harder question. If technique enables style, and you need technique before you can make real choices, then who decides what counts as technique? The institutions. The academies. The people with credentials and certifications. "You need to master the fundamentals before you're allowed to break them" is exactly what gatekeepers say to protect their monopoly on legitimacy.

But here's the distinction that matters: credentials gatekeep, not capability. A degree from an art school doesn't prove you can make choices. A portfolio does. Institutions don't get to define what counts as technique. They just happen to be one place where people develop it. Portfolio over pedigree. Always.

So how do you tell the difference? From the outside, you often can't. The amateur's "abstract" hands and the master's deliberate abstraction might look identical. You can't judge capability from a single piece of output.

From the inside, though, the test is simple: try something else. If you can't, or if you've never tried, what you call "style" might be the shape of your cage. Some "styles" dissolve the moment you learn the thing you were avoiding. You thought you preferred short sentences until you learned to write long ones and discovered you still preferred them. Now it's a choice. Or you learn to write long ones and realize you only wrote short ones because you couldn't sustain a thought. The technique didn't change your style. It revealed it.

None of this is about earning permission to create. You don't need credentials, approval, or mastery before you're allowed to make things. Create now, with whatever you have. But know the difference between freedom and accident. Between choosing simplicity and being stuck with it. Between a style you've developed and a limitation you've rationalized.

Your authentic voice might be waiting on the other side of technique. Or it might be what you discover you'd choose anyway, once you actually have the choice. Either way, you won't know until you expand what's possible. Style is the residue of choices. Make sure you have some.
