# Style Is the Residue of Choices

The amateur who can't draw hands and the master who chooses to abstract them are doing fundamentally different things—even if the output looks similar. One is constrained by inability. The other is making a choice from a position of capability.

This distinction matters more than we like to admit. Style is the residue of choices. To have a choice, you need options. To have options, you need capability. Without that capability, what you call "style" is just the shape of your limitations.

Think of it this way: technique is vocabulary. Style is what you choose to say. If you only know fifty words, you're not making a stylistic choice to write simply—you just don't know any others. The writer with a ten-thousand-word vocabulary who writes in plain language is doing something different from the writer who never learned the bigger words. Same output, different act.
