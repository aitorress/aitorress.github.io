# Author Input: Technique vs Style

## Session: 2026-01-22

### Personal Experience

**Jazz guitar as lived example of the tension:**
- Feels limited while playing jazz guitar — aware of being "well below standard capabilities"
- The limitation shows up as: hearing something but not being able to execute it because of insufficient practice / not having "broken the barrier"
- In a state of flow, those ideas never come because they're not part of muscle memory or repertoire
- Current state: "my style is pretty much all I can do"
- Knows that with more work, will be able to "pick and choose" — that's when it becomes real style vs limitation
- Notes that in complex domains like jazz, everyone probably feels caged at different points

### Author's Position

**On outsider art:**
- Doesn't know what outsider art is — needs research before taking a position
- Flagged for `/draft-research`

**On gatekeeping:**
- Credentials gatekeep, not capability itself
- Institutions gatekeep by not expanding access to credentials
- In professional world: portfolio > education (what you can do > credentials)
- Higher ed credentials are "more of a vanity metric"
- Key distinction: "technique matters" ≠ "institutions decide who's legitimate"

**On scope beyond art:**
- Yes, the framework extends beyond creative fields
- Connects to the credentialing point — applies to professional domains generally

### What to Emphasize

**Purpose of the piece:**
- Push people to not hide behind "that's my style"
- Learn the rules of the game so you can intentionally break them

### Raw Quotes

- "In a state of flow, those ideas would never come because they're not part of my muscle memory or repertoire"
- "My style is pretty much all I can do, but I know that if I keep working on it and expanding, I'll be able to pick and choose"
- "That's where I would really be able to say that I have a style vs a limitation"
- "In incredibly complex domains such as jazz, it wouldn't surprise me everyone feels caged at different points in time"

### Still Needed

- Research on outsider art / Art Brut before author can take a position on that counterargument
