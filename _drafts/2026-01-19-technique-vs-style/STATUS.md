# Technique vs Style — Status

## Current Phase
Awaiting author decision on outsider art position

## Completed
- [x] Analysis (2026-01-22)
- [x] Author input gathered (2026-01-22)
- [x] Research: Outsider art / Art Brut / Dubuffet (2026-01-22)

## In Progress
- [ ] Author position on outsider art

## Still Needed
- [ ] Structure proposal
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Polish

## Open Questions
- How do you tell choice from limitation from the outside? (Raised but not answered — may not need to answer, just acknowledge)
- When does technique become a prison? (Needs engagement, not just acknowledgment)

## Key Decisions Made
- **Personal anchor:** Jazz guitar experience — author has lived the tension
- **Gatekeeping defense:** "Credentials gatekeep, not capability. Portfolio > pedigree."
- **Scope:** Extends beyond art to professional domains generally
- **Purpose:** Push people to not hide behind "that's my style" — learn the rules so you can break them intentionally

## Notes
Strong personal material now. The jazz guitar experience is the concrete grounding the piece needed.

Next: Research outsider art so author can take an informed position on the strongest counterargument. Then structure.
