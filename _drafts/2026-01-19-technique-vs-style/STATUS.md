# Technique vs Style — Status

## Current Phase
Analysis

## Completed
- [x] Analysis (2026-01-22)

## In Progress
[None yet]

## Still Needed
- [ ] Research: Outsider art / Art Brut defense (Dubuffet's actual arguments)
- [ ] Research: Artists who gained technique late — what happened to their style?
- [ ] Author input: Personal experience with this tension
- [ ] Author input: How to address the gatekeeping critique
- [ ] Structure proposal
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Polish

## Open Questions
- How do you tell choice from limitation from the outside? (Raised but not answered)
- When does technique become a prison? The counterargument needs engagement, not just acknowledgment.
- Does this apply beyond art/music? Engineering, business, writing?
- What's the author's actual position on outsider art?

## Notes
Strong draft with sharp core insight. Main risk: the outsider art counterargument is the real challenge and it's currently hand-waved. Either engage it fully or restructure to accommodate it.
