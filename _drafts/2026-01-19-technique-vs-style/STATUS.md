## Key Decisions Made
- **Title:** "Style Is the Residue of Choices"
- **Personal anchor:** Jazz guitar experience — author has lived the tension
- **Gatekeeping defense:** "Credentials gatekeep, not capability. Portfolio > pedigree."
- **Outsider art:** Absorb into argument — proves technique can be self-developed
- **AI angle:** Not included — save for another piece
- **Scope:** Extends beyond art to professional domains generally
- **Purpose:** Push people to not hide behind "that's my style"

## Notes
Section 5 approved. No em-dashes. Continuing expansion.
