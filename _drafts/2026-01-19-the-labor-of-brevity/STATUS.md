# The Labor of Brevity — Status

## Current Phase
Expansion

## Completed
- [x] Analysis (2026-01-24)
- [x] Author input gathered (2026-01-24)
- [x] Research: AI verbosity techniques (2026-01-24)
- [x] Structure approved (2026-01-24)

## In Progress
[None]

## Still Needed
- [ ] Section 1: The Paradox (Hook)
- [ ] Section 2: The Sigh
- [ ] Section 3: Why Compression Is Work
- [ ] Section 4: The Transfer of Labor
- [ ] Section 5: The Flood
- [ ] Section 6: The AI Aside (Skippable)
- [ ] Section 7: The Landing
- [ ] Polish

## Resolved Questions
1. **Audience**: Writers — people who produce long content and need to stop
2. **AI angle**: Keep as skippable aside in middle (section 6), with playful disclaimer
3. **Core position**: Brevity is a virtue, full stop
4. **Personal angle**: "If everything is important then nothing is" — the visceral sigh at a long email
5. **AI placement**: Middle, before landing — serves as evidence for AI readers, skippable for others

## Notes
- Structure approved with 7 sections, ~800-1000 words target
- AI section is optional/skippable with playful transition
- Article completes without AI section (sections 5→7 flow naturally)
- See `structure.md` for full outline with section purposes and sources
- Recommended: Run /draft-expand next
