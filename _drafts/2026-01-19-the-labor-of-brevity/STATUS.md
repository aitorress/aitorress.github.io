# The Labor of Brevity — Status

## Current Phase
Author input gathered — ready for structure

## Completed
- [x] Analysis (2026-01-24)
- [x] Author input gathered (2026-01-24)

## In Progress
[None]

## Still Needed
- [ ] Structure proposal
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Polish

## Resolved Questions
1. **Audience**: Writers — people who produce long content and need to stop
2. **AI angle**: Keep it, strengthen with GRPO detail and "word-meaning ratio" idea
3. **Core position**: Brevity is a virtue, full stop. Context matters but shouldn't undercut the main thrust
4. **Personal angle**: "If everything is important then nothing is" — the visceral sigh at a long email

## Open Questions
1. Should the piece include practical advice (how to be brief) or stay observational?
2. How much to develop the "information flood" angle?

## Notes
- Draft is intellectually well-developed with strong Steel Man and Devil's Advocate sections
- The hook ("Sorry for my long response...") is excellent
- Author provided strong raw quotes ready for use
- New material: GRPO technique, "word-meaning ratio" concept, information flood framing
- Recommended: Run /draft-structure next
