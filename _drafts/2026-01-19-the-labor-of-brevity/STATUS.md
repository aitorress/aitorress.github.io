## Current Phase
Analysis complete

## Completed

- [ ] Structure proposal
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Polish

## Open Questions
1. What's the intended audience for this piece?
2. Should it end with practical advice or is the observation itself the point?
3. Keep or cut the AI/LLM angle?
4. Which 1-2 "Questions Worth Exploring" should this piece actually engage with?
5. Is there a personal experience that could ground the abstractions?
6. How to reconcile "brevity is a virtue" with "optimal length depends on context"?

## Notes
- Draft is intellectually well-developed with strong Steel Man and Devil's Advocate sections
- The hook ("Sorry for my long response...") is excellent
- Main gap is authorial decisions, not research
- Minor research could help: Pascal quote origins, Shannon info theory details
- Recommended: Run /draft-input next
