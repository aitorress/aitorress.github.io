## Polish Summary

### Voice Adjustments
- Fixed "isn't X. It's Y." pattern (varied structure in two places)
- Cut throat-clearing phrases ("Here's the core of it:", "Think about that.", "This reframes the whole thing.")
- Tightened redundant phrasing throughout

### Tightening
- Removed ~70 words of padding
- Combined sentences where flow improved
- Cut "the labor is real" from landing (echoed earlier "This is labor")

### Links Added
- [reward hacking](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/verbosity-compensation-behavior)
- [Dr. GRPO](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/dr-grpo)

## Remaining Concerns
