# Author Input: The Labor of Brevity

## Session: 2026-01-24

### Personal Experience

Not a single revelatory moment, but a pattern: the tendency to write long to show you know the subject, which backfires.

**The core insight in the author's words:** "If everything is important then nothing is. The point trying to be made is lost, because many points are being made, so the effectiveness of the piece is lost."

The labor is in trimming the fat. A lean, effective message is "incredibly rewarding both for the reader and the writer."

**The visceral test:** "Put yourself in the other position, just opening an email and being multiple paragraphs already makes you sigh in exasperation."

**The balance framing:** "It's a balance between the effort you want the reader to make and the effort you want to make as a writer."

### Author's Position

**On the core tension:** Brevity is a virtue, full stop. The contextual stuff (optimal length depends on audience) is true but secondary. If forced to generalize: brevity wins.

**On the AI angle:** Keep it. It's a "nice wink" tying to what the author cares about. AI verbosity is actively penalized in post-training (Dr GRPO technique). This reinforces the point that humans prefer concise communication and are actively engineering systems toward it.

**New angle from author:** "The world is flooding in information we won't be able to ever consume. We need to have a sort of effectiveness metric like word-meaning ratio or something."

### What to Emphasize

- **Audience is writers** — people who produce long content and need to stop
- **The "if everything is important, nothing is" insight** — this is the author's lived version of the core argument
- **The reader's sigh** — the visceral reaction to a long email as a concrete, relatable moment
- **The AI connection** — keep and potentially strengthen with the GRPO detail and "word-meaning ratio" idea
- **Information flood** — the modern context of too much content makes brevity more important than ever

### What to Cut or Minimize

- The "optimal length depends on context" hedge can stay but shouldn't undercut the main thrust
- Less emphasis on defending length in certain domains — the piece should land on "brevity is a virtue"
