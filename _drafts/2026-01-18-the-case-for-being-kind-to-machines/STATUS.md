## Open Questions

**From analysis — must resolve before expansion:**

1. Is there empirical support for the behavioral transfer claim (rudeness to AI → rudeness to humans)?
2. What's the author's personal stake? What triggered this piece?
3. Is the piece advocating for "kindness" or just "not cruelty"? These have different bars.
4. Who is the intended audience?
5. Should the piece commit to positions where it currently hedges (labor frame, line-drawing)?

## Notes

The piece's core insight is strong: moral behavior shapes the actor regardless of whether the recipient "counts." This reframing from "does AI deserve kindness?" to "does practicing kindness make you better?" is the defensible, interesting claim.

The four-argument structure (training, Pascal's Wager, mirror, cultural) is solid. Devil's Advocate is genuinely robust.

Main risk: the behavioral transfer claim is currently unsupported. If research doesn't back it, the piece needs to reframe as philosophical speculation rather than practical ethics.

Recommended next step: `/draft-research` to ground the empirical claims.
