# The Infinite Backlog Paradox

## The Seed

The standard AI narrative goes like this: AI supercharges engineers, so you need fewer of them. A 10x productivity boost means 1/10th the headcount. Simple math.

But there's a hidden assumption doing all the work here: that the amount of software to be built is fixed. If demand is elastic—if there's always more to build—then productivity gains don't reduce headcount. They just mean more gets built.

So which is it? Is software demand a finite pool we're draining, or an infinite ocean?

## Steel Man

The "AI reduces engineering jobs" argument is stronger than it first appears:

**The backlog is fake.** Most feature requests in any backlog are political theater, pet projects, or things stakeholders *think* they want but would never actually use. When you make engineering cheaper, you don't suddenly build all that garbage—you just build the important stuff faster and then stop. The backlog isn't a queue of genuine demand; it's a graveyard of things that were never worth doing.

**Jevons Paradox has limits.** Yes, making something cheaper often increases total consumption (coal, computing, etc.). But software isn't coal. There's a ceiling on how much software any organization actually needs. Netflix doesn't need 10x more features. Your bank doesn't need 10x more apps. At some point, you're done.

**The value curve is steep.** The first 20% of features deliver 80% of value. Making engineering faster might mean you hit that 80% sooner and stop there, rather than grinding through the long tail. Cheaper doesn't mean you buy more; it means you buy exactly what you need, faster.

**Capital follows returns, not capacity.** Companies don't employ engineers because they have infinite ideas. They employ engineers to capture specific market opportunities. When AI lets you capture those opportunities with fewer people, you pocket the savings. You don't invent new opportunities just because you suddenly have spare engineering capacity.

## Devil's Advocate

But this argument has a fatal flaw: it assumes companies are already building everything worth building. They're not even close.

**The 80/20 is a lie.** Every product team will tell you they've only shipped 80% of the good ideas, not 80% of the value. The features that got cut weren't worthless—they were just slightly less important than what shipped. Make engineering 10x cheaper and suddenly they're all viable.

**Software quality is artificially constrained.** Most software is mediocre because there wasn't time to make it good. Faster engineering doesn't mean "build less"—it means "build properly." That's more engineering, not less.

**The real bottleneck is ideas.** If AI makes building cheap, the constraint shifts upstream to product and design. You'll need more people to figure out what to build. Engineering headcount might drop, but total tech employment might not.

**Look at history.** Every major productivity tool—spreadsheets, databases, the internet, cloud computing—was supposed to reduce headcount. Total software employment has only ever grown. Why would AI be different?

## First-Order Effects

If the "infinite demand" thesis is correct:

1. **AI doesn't reduce engineering headcount—it changes what engineers do.** Less time typing code, more time on system design, integration, and the hard parts AI can't touch.

2. **Previously uneconomical projects become viable.** The long tail of ideas that were "good but not worth the investment" suddenly gets built. Internal tools, automation, quality-of-life features.

3. **Speed becomes the new bottleneck.** If building is fast and cheap, the constraint moves to decisions. Product management and design become the rate-limiting step.

4. **The bar for "good enough" rises.** When software is expensive, mediocre is acceptable. When it's cheap, users expect polish. More gets built, and all of it needs to be better.

5. **Junior engineering roles compress.** The routine work AI handles is exactly the work juniors used to do. Senior roles might be safe, but the entry path narrows.

## Second-Order Effects

Here's where it gets interesting:

**The definition of "engineer" expands.** If AI handles the coding, more people can direct the building. Product managers become builder-adjacent. Designers prototype directly. The line between "technical" and "non-technical" blurs. Engineering headcount drops; people-who-ship headcount rises.

**Companies compete on ambition, not execution.** When building is cheap, everyone can build. The scarce resource becomes vision—knowing what's worth building. This favors small teams with taste over large teams with process.

**Technical debt becomes unacceptable.** Rewriting is no longer expensive. "We can't fix that, it would take six months" becomes "we can fix that by Thursday." Legacy systems get replaced rather than maintained. This actually creates more work, not less.

**The geographic arbitrage of engineering ends.** If AI can do what a junior developer in a low-cost region does, there's no advantage to hiring there. Talent competition becomes genuinely global—everyone competes for the senior people who can direct AI effectively.

**Startups get more dangerous.** Two people with AI can build what used to require twenty. Incumbents can't rely on "they can't match our engineering resources" anymore. Speed and iteration rate matter more than raw capacity.

## The Tension You're Sensing

You're circling a deeper question: **Is software a product or an infrastructure?**

If software is a *product*—like cars or refrigerators—then demand is finite. There are only so many cars anyone needs. Make them cheaper and you hit saturation faster.

But if software is *infrastructure*—like roads or electricity—then demand is essentially infinite. The more you build, the more becomes possible. Cheaper roads don't mean fewer roads; they mean more roads to more places.

The current tech narrative treats software like a product. "We need to build X app." But software is increasingly infrastructure. Every process, every interaction, every decision could be mediated by software. We're nowhere near saturation.

The people predicting engineering job losses are thinking in products. The people predicting no change are thinking in infrastructure. You're sensing that the infrastructure view is probably right, but the product view is how companies actually budget.

## Questions Worth Exploring

1. **When has a productivity tool ever reduced total employment in its field?** Accounting software, design tools, manufacturing automation—did any of them reduce total headcount in their industries, or just change the composition?

2. **What's the actual utilization rate of engineering capacity?** How much engineering time goes to the backlog vs. maintenance vs. meetings vs. waiting for decisions? If it's not 100% productive building new things, there's slack AI might not touch.

3. **Is AI productivity gains uniform or concentrated?** Does AI help a 10x engineer become 100x, or does it help a 1x engineer become 3x? The distribution matters for whether jobs concentrate or dissipate.

4. **What happens to the engineers who get displaced?** If senior engineers remain valuable and juniors get compressed out, where do new seniors come from? Is there a missing rung on the ladder?

5. **Who benefits if the "infinite demand" thesis is right?** If more gets built with the same headcount, shareholders capture all the productivity gains. If headcount stays same but output grows, workers might share in it. The political economy matters.

6. **What's the latency between productivity gains and job impacts?** Even if the "fewer engineers" thesis is right, it could take a decade to shake out. In the short term, everything looks like "infinite demand."

7. **Could both be true?** Fewer engineers in big companies (where work is more defined), more engineers in startups and small companies (where work expands to fill capacity)?

## Raw Material

- "The backlog isn't a queue—it's a graveyard of good ideas that were slightly less important than what shipped."

- "AI doesn't eliminate engineers. It promotes product managers to people-who-ship."

- "Cheaper software means more software the same way cheaper electricity meant more appliances. We're not running out of things to plug in."

- "The 10x productivity narrative assumes companies are already building everything worth building. They're barely scratching the surface."

- "Every productivity tool in history was supposed to reduce jobs. Total employment in every field has only grown. Why would this time be different?"

- "Software is infrastructure, not product. We're nowhere near saturation. We're still building roads to places that don't exist yet."

- "The people predicting job losses are thinking in products. The people predicting no change are thinking in infrastructure."

- The Jevons Paradox for software: make building cheaper, and more gets built. Make it drastically cheaper, and *everyone* builds.

## Next Steps

1. **Find the historical data.** What happened to total employment in accounting after spreadsheets? In graphic design after Adobe? In manufacturing after automation? The pattern will either support or refute your intuition.

2. **Interview 3-5 engineering leaders.** Ask them: "If engineering became 10x faster tomorrow, what would you build that you're not building today?" The answers reveal whether demand is truly elastic or if the backlog is fake.

3. **Write the counter-post.** Steelman the other side: "Why AI Actually Will Reduce Engineering Jobs." If you can make that argument compelling, you'll know where the real crux is.
