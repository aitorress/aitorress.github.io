# Technique vs Style: The Craft You Can't Fake

## The Seed

Lack of technique is not style. The amateur who can't draw hands and the master who chooses to abstract them are doing fundamentally different things—even if the output looks similar. One is constrained by inability, the other is making a choice from a position of capability.

## Steel Man

Style is the residue of *choices*. To have a choice, you need options. To have options, you need capability. A musician who only knows three chords isn't choosing simplicity—they're stuck with it. The Ramones knew how to play; they chose not to. Picasso could render photorealistic portraits before he dismantled the human form. Hemingway's sparse prose came after years of journalism and revision, not before he learned to write complex sentences.

The strongest version of this argument: technique creates the *space* for style to emerge. Without it, what you call "style" is just the shape of your limitations. It's like calling a cage a room because you've never been outside.

This matters because it prevents false equivalence. The Instagram artist who can't do anatomy isn't "doing their own thing"—they're doing the only thing they can do. The trained artist who distorts anatomy is making a statement. The difference is authorship. One is happening to you; the other is something you're doing.

## Devil's Advocate

Here's where this gets uncomfortable: some of the most important art came from people who didn't know the rules. Outsider art. Punk rock. Folk traditions. The Shaggs. Henri Rousseau. Grandma Moses.

There's also a gatekeeping risk here. "You need to master the fundamentals before you're allowed to break them" is exactly what institutions say to protect their monopoly on legitimacy. It can become a way to dismiss work that doesn't fit established patterns.

And here's the sharper critique: technique can become a prison too. The person who's mastered classical form may be *less* capable of innovation because they've internalized constraints so deeply they can't see past them. Sometimes ignorance is creative freedom.

Finally: does the audience care? If the output moves people, does the creator's level of technical skill actually matter? Isn't that just credentialism applied to art?

## First-Order Effects

If this is true:

1. **Education matters, but differently.** Learning technique isn't about doing things "correctly"—it's about expanding your option set. The goal isn't to follow rules; it's to have rules available to break.

2. **Self-assessment gets harder.** You have to honestly distinguish between "I chose this" and "I can only do this." That requires trying things you might fail at.

3. **Some "styles" dissolve on examination.** When you learn the thing you were avoiding, you find out if your "choice" was ever a choice at all.

4. **Credentials don't equal capability.** Someone can have formal training and still be constrained. The degree isn't the point; the expanded possibility space is.

5. **Copying becomes more complex.** You can't copy a master's style by imitating their output—you have to develop the capability that made the output possible. The shortcut doesn't exist.

## Second-Order Effects

This ripples into interesting places:

**AI art and the technique question.** When AI generates images, there's no technique underneath—just pattern matching on outputs. This is why AI art often feels hollow even when it's visually impressive. It's all "style" with no capability behind it. The choices aren't choices because there's no alternative that was rejected.

**The cult of authenticity.** Modern culture valorizes "being yourself" and "finding your voice." But if yourself is just your constraints, that's not authenticity—it's being trapped. Real authenticity might require technique first, so you can discover what you'd choose if you could choose anything.

**Why some prodigies flame out.** Child prodigies often develop a "style" that's actually just their early limitations. When they mature and gain technique, they have to rebuild their identity. Some can't.

**The beginner's luck problem.** Sometimes beginners produce striking work precisely because they don't know what they're "supposed" to do. But they usually can't repeat it—because it wasn't a choice. The question is whether they can develop technique and then find their way back to that freedom intentionally.

**Minimalism's dirty secret.** A lot of what passes for minimalist aesthetic is actually inability dressed up in philosophy. Real minimalism—Dieter Rams, Agnes Martin, Cormac McCarthy—requires knowing exactly what to leave out, which means knowing what could have been there.

## The Tension You're Sensing

You're circling the difference between **freedom** and **accident**.

Style feels like freedom. But freedom requires options, options require capability, and capability requires technique. So style—real style, chosen style—sits *on top of* technique, not in opposition to it.

The contradiction: we want to believe creativity is about unlearning constraints, but actually it's about having so many options that your constraints become choices. The jazz musician who "breaks the rules" knows the rules so thoroughly they've become a tool rather than a cage.

The deeper tension: this feels elitist, but it might just be true. And if it's true, a lot of what we celebrate as authentic self-expression is actually just... being stuck.

## Questions Worth Exploring

1. **The inversion:** Is there such a thing as too much technique? At what point does capability become a cage of its own?

2. **The beneficiary question:** Who benefits from the idea that technique doesn't matter? Who benefits from saying it does?

3. **The historical parallel:** How did the Academies of the 19th century handle this tension? They had technique but killed style. How?

4. **The edge case:** What about outsider artists who develop their own internal "technique" without formal training? Is that different?

5. **The test:** How do you tell the difference between a stylistic choice and a limitation, from the outside? From the inside?

6. **The AI question:** If an AI can mimic any style without technique, does that break this framework or prove it?

7. **The process question:** Does it matter if you develop technique first and then style, or can you work backwards—discover your "style" in your limitations and then develop technique that lets you choose it deliberately?

## Raw Material

- "Style is the residue of choices. No choices, no style—just the shape of your cage."

- "Picasso earned the right to draw like a child. Most people just draw like children."

- "The amateur and the master can produce the same output. The difference is that only one of them could have produced something else."

- "Freedom isn't the absence of technique. It's technique internalized so deeply it becomes invisible."

- "AI has infinite style and zero technique. That's why it feels like everything and nothing."

- "Your authentic voice might just be your current limitations talking."

- "Minimalism is what's left after you know everything you could have added."

- Metaphor: Technique is vocabulary. Style is what you choose to say. Without vocabulary, you're not making a stylistic choice to use simple words—you just don't know any others.

- Metaphor: A child banging on a piano and Keith Jarrett both produce "unexpected" sounds. One is noise; the other is jazz.

## Next Steps

1. **Research outsider art movements.** The strongest counterarguments live here. How do defenders of Art Brut handle the technique question? What did Dubuffet actually argue?

2. **Find examples of artists who developed technique late and changed.** Did their "style" survive gaining capability? What happened to their work?

3. **Write the counter-post.** "In Defense of Limitations"—make the argument that constraints are generative and technique can calcify creativity. See if it holds up.
