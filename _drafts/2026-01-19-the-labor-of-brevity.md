# The Labor of Brevity

## The Seed

"Sorry for my long response, I didn't have time to write a shorter one." The joke lands because it inverts our intuitions. We assume length requires effort and brevity is laziness. But the opposite is true: compression is work. Verbosity is what happens when you don't do the work.

## Steel Man

This isn't just a cute aphorism—it's a fundamental truth about communication and cognition.

**The distillation argument:** Writing long is easy because it mirrors how we think—associatively, recursively, with tangents and hedges and qualifications. Our raw thought process is messy. Short writing requires distilling that mess into its essence, which means you have to actually *understand* what you're saying. Many long documents exist because the author never figured out their own point.

**The revision argument:** First drafts are always long. The short version emerges through passes of cutting, restructuring, finding the load-bearing sentences and removing the scaffolding. This is labor. Most people ship the first draft because deadlines, because ego, because they mistake volume for thoroughness.

**The reader-cost argument:** Every word you write is a word someone has to read. Concision is a form of respect. The long version transfers work from writer to reader—you couldn't be bothered to edit, so they have to do the parsing. It's cognitive debt passed downstream.

**The clarity argument:** Confusion hides in length. When you're not sure what you think, you write more words hoping some combination will land. When you know exactly what you mean, you can say it in a sentence. Brevity is a symptom of clarity—you can't be concise about something you don't understand.

**The historical evidence:** Pascal, Twain, Cicero, Woodrow Wilson, and a dozen others have versions of this quote. When multiple brilliant people across centuries independently observe the same thing, it's probably tracking something real about the nature of writing.

## Devil's Advocate

The strongest counter: Sometimes long *is* the right length, and fetishizing brevity produces its own pathologies.

**The oversimplification trap:** Some ideas are genuinely complex. Forcing them into short form doesn't clarify—it strips away necessary nuance. Twitter-brained thinking isn't wisdom; it's compression artifacts mistaken for insight. "Make it shorter" can be an excuse to avoid grappling with real complexity.

**The context collapse problem:** Brevity assumes shared context. When context isn't shared, short writing becomes cryptic or easily misinterpreted. The length of an explanation should match the gap between your understanding and your reader's—sometimes that gap requires words.

**The Hemingway cult:** The obsession with brevity has created a writing culture that mistakes terseness for profundity. Sometimes a long, discursive essay is exactly the right form. Montaigne wasn't failing at brevity; he was doing something different.

**The effort-quality conflation:** Just because brevity requires work doesn't mean all brief writing is good, or that the work always pays off. You can spend hours cutting a mediocre idea down to a tight mediocre sentence. The labor of compression can become a procrastination strategy—polishing instead of thinking.

**The asymmetry of trust:** Long-form writing lets readers verify your reasoning. Brief writing asks them to trust your conclusions. In contexts where trust is low, showing your work matters more than saving words.

## First-Order Effects

1. **The edit becomes primary:** If you believe compression is the work, you stop trying to get it right on the first pass and start expecting multiple revisions. The writing process shifts from "drafting" to "sculpting."

2. **Length signals flip:** In a culture that understands this, a long document becomes slightly embarrassing—evidence of insufficient thinking time—rather than evidence of thoroughness. A tight one-pager gains status.

3. **Deadlines have a cost:** Rushing means shipping the long version. You can now see the tradeoff clearly: more time to write = less time for reader to read. Organizations might start budgeting differently.

4. **The illusion of productivity drops:** Word counts and page counts look less impressive when you realize they might indicate the opposite of effort. "I wrote a ten-page memo" becomes ambiguous praise.

5. **Reading improves:** When writers take compression seriously, readers can read more with less effort. The total amount of information transferred per hour of reading goes up.

## Second-Order Effects

**The meeting parallel:** If brevity requires preparation, then long rambling meetings are the verbal equivalent of unedited drafts. "I didn't have time to plan a shorter meeting" becomes a legible excuse. Organizations that understand this might start demanding prep time before meetings rather than more meetings.

**The AI irony:** Large language models are trained on human text, which skews long. They inherit our failure modes—the hedging, the redundancy, the saying-five-times-what-needs-saying-once. An AI that writes concisely is fighting its training distribution. (This is also why AI often makes things *longer* rather than shorter.)

**The expertise marker:** True experts can explain their field simply. The Feynman test: if you can't explain it briefly, you don't understand it. Length becomes a weak signal of shaky understanding rather than deep knowledge. This changes how we evaluate expertise.

**Compression as filtering:** If you require people to be brief, you're requiring them to have thought clearly. Brevity requirements become a filter for intellectual seriousness. This is why Twitter can be such a good place to find smart people despite being a terrible place generally—the character limit forces distillation.

**The educational implication:** Schools teach writing by word counts and page minimums. This trains exactly the wrong habit. What if we graded inversely? "Make this argument in under 200 words" as a test of mastery rather than endurance.

## The Tension You're Sensing

You're circling the question of where value comes from in communication.

The naive view: Value correlates with volume. More words = more content = more value. Writing is production, and production is measured in units produced.

The sophisticated counter: Value correlates with *compression ratio*—how much meaning per word. The ideal piece of writing contains the maximum insight in the minimum space. Value isn't what you put in; it's what you leave out while keeping the meaning intact.

But there's a third layer you might be sensing: *the optimal length depends on the reader*. A brief summary is worthless if it assumes knowledge I don't have. A long explanation is wasteful if I already know most of it. Perfect writing would be infinitely adaptive—expanding for novices, compressing for experts. Since that's impossible, every piece of writing is a compromise, calibrated to some assumed reader.

The real tension: We praise brevity as a universal virtue, but it's actually a *contextual* virtue. The quote is true for most writing because most writing overestimates how much context the reader needs—or underestimates how much the writer doesn't understand their own point. But it's not a law of nature. Sometimes the long version is right.

## Questions Worth Exploring

1. **The inversion:** Is there a domain where *length* requires more effort than brevity? Legal contracts? Academic writing? Where does "make it longer" represent the harder task?

2. **The recipient test:** How do you know if something is too long vs. appropriately thorough? Is there a reliable signal from readers, or do they also not know?

3. **The silence version:** If compression is a virtue in writing, what's the equivalent in conversation? Is "not saying something" the ultimate compression? What does it mean that we rarely praise silence the way we praise concision?

4. **The genre question:** Why do some genres (poetry, aphorisms, technical specs) reward brevity while others (novels, academic papers, therapy sessions) reward length? What determines which is appropriate?

5. **The AI collaboration:** Could AI eventually do the compression work for us? Write the long messy version, let the machine distill it? Or is the distillation itself the thinking, such that outsourcing it means never understanding your own ideas?

6. **The ego element:** Is there something self-protective about length? If I write more, I can always say "you missed the part where I addressed that." Brevity is more exposed—no hedge-caveat-qualifier to hide behind. Is the labor of brevity partly the labor of accepting vulnerability?

7. **The economics:** Why don't we see more brevity in practice, given its obvious advantages? What are the incentive structures that produce verbosity? (Billing by the hour? Academic word counts? Looking busy? Fear of seeming simplistic?)

## Raw Material

- First drafts are long because thinking is messy. Editing is the process of cleaning up after your own cognition.
- "Every word you write is a word someone has to read." Brevity is a debt you *don't* pass to your reader.
- The LLM problem: trained on human text, which means trained on unedited drafts, which means the model's default is our failure mode.
- Feynman test for understanding: If you can't explain it briefly, you don't understand it. Length as a smell for shaky expertise.
- The meeting parallel: "Sorry for the long meeting, I didn't have time to plan a shorter one."
- Schools train word counts. We're literally teaching the wrong skill.
- Brevity as vulnerability: No hedges to hide behind when you're concise.
- Twitter's accidental genius: the character limit as a forcing function for clear thinking.
- "The long version is the writer's rough draft. The short version is the reader's reward."

## Next Steps

1. **Find the counterexamples:** Look for domains where long is genuinely better—where compression loses essential information. Legal writing? Philosophy? What makes those different?

2. **Test the AI angle:** Take a rambling piece of writing and ask an LLM to compress it. Compare to human editing. Where does AI compression fail? What does that reveal about what compression requires?

3. **Interview a professional editor:** Someone whose job is literally making things shorter. What do they see? What patterns of verbosity do they encounter most? What's the hardest thing to cut?
