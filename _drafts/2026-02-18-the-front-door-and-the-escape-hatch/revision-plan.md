Prioritized revision items, highest ROI first:

## 1. Expand the personal experience beat
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Both critics flagged this. Galloway wants specificity; Housel wants duration. The paragraph where you land on a chat-first product is the most alive writing in the piece but it passes in one breath. It's generic where it should be particular.
- **Why it matters:** This is the emotional anchor of the argument. The reader's recognition ("I've done this too") is what makes the design theory land. Without a vivid moment, the Norman analysis reads like a textbook.
- **Suggested fix:** Name a product (or describe one recognizably). Add a specific detail: what were you trying to do? What did you type? How long before you closed the tab? Two to three sentences of lived-in detail, not a full scene.
- **Questions to resolve:** Is the author comfortable naming a specific product, or does it need to stay composite? How much length can this section absorb before it feels indulgent?

## 2. Promote the ChatGPT-adding-front-doors observation
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Both critics identified this as the piece's strongest new weapon, currently buried at the end of Section 3 (the longest section). Galloway says promote it; Housel agrees it's underweight.
- **Why it matters:** "The product that defined 'text box in the center of the screen' has been quietly adding front doors ever since" is evidence by implication. It turns OpenAI's own product evolution against the AI-purist position. Readers who skim will miss it.
- **Suggested fix:** Consider moving it to open Section 4 (as the bridge from "what's wrong" to "what works") or giving it its own short beat with a line break. It needs visual separation from the data paragraph above it.
- **Questions to resolve:** Does it work better as the capstone of the "white flag" argument (current position) or as the opening of the "front door" evidence (new position)?

## 3. Strengthen failure cases with consequence
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Galloway's point: the failure cases are entertaining but weightless. A TikTok got 100K likes, Fortune wrote a headline. But what actually happened? The reader doesn't learn what these failures cost.
- **Why it matters:** Failure cases without consequence read as mockery, not evidence. The reader thinks "that's funny" instead of "that's important." Numbers (engagement drop, reversal timeline, user loss) would make these cases load-bearing.
- **Suggested fix:** Research whether Meta reversed the Instagram change or saw measurable engagement impact. For LinkedIn, note that they pulled the feature (already there) and add any available data on AI content engagement decline (the research file has: "AI-generated posts get 30% less reach and 55% less engagement"). Consider cutting LinkedIn entirely per Housel and going deeper on Meta.
- **Questions to resolve:** Cut LinkedIn and go deeper on Meta, or keep both but add consequence to each? Is the 30%/55% engagement stat from the research file strong enough to use?

## 4. Address the Rufus repetition
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Housel noticed that the Rufus zero-percent finding appears twice (Section 3 and Section 6). The second mention re-introduces it ("The Rufus study wasn't an edge case") as if the reader might have forgotten.
- **Why it matters:** Repeating your strongest data point makes your evidence base feel thin. It suggests you don't have enough examples and need to recycle.
- **Suggested fix:** Keep the full data in Section 3 (where it's evidence for the white-flag argument). In Section 6, reference it without restating: "The discoverability data tells the same story" or "We already saw what happens when you test this." Better yet, find a second example for Section 6 that reinforces the point from a different angle.
- **Questions to resolve:** Is there a non-Rufus discoverability study that could anchor Section 6 independently?

## 5. Give "the structure itself teaches" room to breathe
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Housel flagged this as potentially the deepest idea in the piece, currently compressed into a single beat within the Notion example. "Each `/` command is a small tutorial" is an insight about how constraints create understanding, not just about Notion's UX.
- **Why it matters:** This idea elevates the argument from "front doors are better" (a design preference) to "structure is how humans learn" (a cognitive claim). That's the difference between a blog post and an essay people remember.
- **Suggested fix:** Add one or two sentences that universalize the insight beyond Notion. "This is what good structure does: it teaches as it constrains. Every guardrail is a lesson about what's possible." Or connect it to the Norman principles already cited.
- **Questions to resolve:** Does universalizing this risk making Section 4 too philosophical? Is the author comfortable making the cognitive claim, or does it overextend the piece's scope?

## 6. Make the tweet attribution specific
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Galloway's point: "I saw a tweet" is vague where the piece argues for specificity. It reads like a straw man or, worse, a hedge.
- **Why it matters:** The piece opens by criticizing products that don't take a stand. A vague tweet attribution is the prose equivalent of a blank text box: it avoids commitment.
- **Suggested fix:** Either find and link the actual tweet, or reconstruct the argument specifically enough that the reader can see exactly what position you're responding to. "A tweet arguing that buttons and layouts are 'training wheels for a generation that won't need them'" is more useful than "something about how traditional UI is dead."
- **Questions to resolve:** Does the author have the original tweet? If not, is a reconstructed quote better than the current vague reference?

## 7. Evaluate the CLI/GUI section for audience fit
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Galloway questioned whether "product people, broadly defined" will connect with a section about VS Code and terminals. The irony observation at the end is sharp, but the setup assumes technical literacy.
- **Why it matters:** If the audience has to work to understand the analogy, they'll disengage before reaching the payoff (the designers-vs-developers irony).
- **Suggested fix:** Two options: (a) Shorten the setup and lead with the irony, using CLI/GUI as a quick illustration rather than a full section. (b) Reframe in more accessible terms: "The tools developers use have always had two modes" rather than assuming the reader knows what an integrated terminal is.
- **Questions to resolve:** Is the author willing to trim this section? Is the developers-vs-designers irony strong enough to carry a shorter version?

## 8. Sharpen the close
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Housel says "The point is the thing you came to do" is quietly devastating and doesn't need the final line after it. Galloway wants something actionable. Both agree the close is strong but has one element too many.
- **Why it matters:** The last line is what the reader carries. If the final sentence undercuts the penultimate one, the piece ends a half-step weaker than it should.
- **Suggested fix:** Test two versions: (a) End on "The point is the thing you came to do." (b) Keep the current last line but make it actionable per Galloway ("Next time you're reviewing a product, ask: does this put the AI at the center, or the user?"). Read both aloud.
- **Questions to resolve:** Does the author prefer the poetic close (Housel's instinct) or the actionable close (Galloway's instinct)?
