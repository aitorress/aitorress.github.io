Prioritized revision items, highest ROI first:

## 1. Balance the success section (Notion vs Cursor vs Linear)
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Both critics flagged this. Notion gets a rich paragraph with genuine insight ("constraints teach"). Cursor gets five sentences of description. Linear gets three. The unevenness makes the stronger examples carry the weaker ones instead of each earning its place.
- **Why it matters:** Three examples at unequal depth is worse than two at equal depth. The reader feels the drop in quality between Notion and Cursor/Linear, which undermines the pattern the section is trying to establish.
- **Suggested fix:** Two options: (a) Deepen Cursor and Linear to match Notion's treatment (add meaning, not just description). (b) Cut Linear, go deeper on Cursor. Two rich examples beat three uneven ones. If keeping Cursor, draw out what the hierarchy (Tab > Cmd+K > Chat) teaches about progressive disclosure, the way the Notion paragraph drew out what `/` commands teach about constraints.
- **Questions to resolve:** Does the author want three examples or two? Is Linear earning its place, or is it making the same point as Notion (structured UI > chat)?

## 2. Add genuine complexity or uncertainty somewhere
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Housel's recurring note across both rounds. The piece confirms its thesis in every section. The "Both Camps" rewrite added generosity, but the structure is still: thesis > evidence > more evidence > restatement. The reader nods but never encounters surprise.
- **Why it matters:** Essays people remember usually made them uncomfortable before they made them certain. A moment of genuine "but wait, what about..." makes the conclusion feel discovered rather than predetermined.
- **Suggested fix:** The CLI section is the natural place. Developers have had both paradigms for forty years, and the trend in developer tools (Cursor's agent mode, agentic coding) is actually pushing toward MORE AI autonomy, not less. That complicates the "UI comes first" thesis in an interesting way. Acknowledge the tension, then explain why it doesn't break the argument (agents still need the editor as context).
- **Questions to resolve:** Is the author comfortable introducing a counterpoint in the piece? Does agentic coding weaken or strengthen the front-door argument?

## 3. Strengthen the closing section ("The Catch")
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Both critics flagged this differently. Galloway wants an actionable sentence. Housel says the section restates instead of revealing. Four short paragraphs for the culmination of the piece.
- **Why it matters:** The close is where the reader decides if the piece was worth their time. "UI comes first" is the thesis restated, not a new insight. The discoverability beat ("most users never find the AI") is genuinely interesting and gets only two sentences.
- **Suggested fix:** Expand the discoverability observation (what happens when users DO find AI features? what does the discovery curve look like?). Add one actionable sentence before the final line, aimed at builders: something like "ask whether your interface teaches or just listens." Keep the final line untouched.
- **Questions to resolve:** Does the author have a personal observation about the discovery moment? Would an actionable line feel like a Galloway move that doesn't fit the piece's tone?

## 4. Make the tweet attribution specific
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Galloway flagged this in both rounds. "I saw a tweet last week" is vague. The piece argues for products that take a stand; the inciting incident should too.
- **Why it matters:** An anonymous tweet reads like a straw man. A named person with a linked post reads like engagement with a real position.
- **Suggested fix:** Either find and link the actual tweet, or reconstruct the argument with enough specificity that the reader sees the exact position being dismantled. If the tweet can't be found, consider replacing "I saw a tweet" with a more specific formulation: "The argument keeps showing up: buttons and menus are training wheels..."
- **Questions to resolve:** Does the author have the original tweet? If not, is removing the attribution entirely better than keeping it vague?

## 5. Source the "5%" number or reframe it
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Galloway's point. "Operating at maybe 5%" appears in the opening logic and the 5%-to-something-real climbing metaphor. It reads like a statistic but has no source.
- **Why it matters:** Precise-sounding numbers without sources erode trust, especially in a piece built on real data (Sequoia, Smashing, etc.).
- **Suggested fix:** Either find a source (usage data showing most people use basic features only) or reframe as explicitly subjective: "a fraction of what the tool can do." The word "maybe" helps but doesn't fully solve it.
- **Questions to resolve:** Is there research on what percentage of AI tool capabilities typical users access? Would "a fraction" land as well as "5%"?

## 6. Give "crystal cage" a second appearance
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Housel's note. The image is introduced in line 28 and never returns. It's the most memorable new phrase in the piece.
- **Why it matters:** The best metaphors in a piece earn their return. One callback creates a throughline the reader feels even if they can't name it.
- **Suggested fix:** One callback, not overuse. Possibilities: in the close ("The crystal cage was beautiful, but the point was never the cage"), or in the white flag section ("A crystal cage is still a cage"). Just once.
- **Questions to resolve:** Where does it fit most naturally? Does the author want to make "crystal cage" a signature image of the piece, or keep it contained to the Both Camps section?

## 7. Add specificity to the experience paragraph
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Housel's note. "You know the experience" is universal but impersonal. The previous personal anecdote didn't fit; the second-person version is safe but not memorable.
- **Why it matters:** This paragraph is the emotional anchor. If it's generic, the Don Norman analysis that follows reads like a textbook instead of an insight rooted in frustration.
- **Suggested fix:** Add one specific detail without fabricating an anecdote. A product name, a task, a time of day. "You open a new AI tool to help rewrite a paragraph, and you're staring at a cursor wondering how to describe what you want changed" is more alive than "you know the experience."
- **Questions to resolve:** Is the author comfortable naming a specific product or task? What's a real moment they could anchor this to?

## 8. Evaluate LinkedIn as sole failure case
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Galloway's point. One failure against three successes feels asymmetric. The reader might think LinkedIn is an isolated case rather than a pattern.
- **Why it matters:** The pattern claim ("the opposite approach is just as instructive") needs enough evidence to feel like a pattern, not an anecdote.
- **Suggested fix:** Two options: (a) Add a second failure case (Google's AI Overviews backlash, or a developer tool that went too AI-first). (b) Make LinkedIn heavier by adding consequence: what happened to engagement after the pullback? Did it damage the platform's professional credibility?
- **Questions to resolve:** Does the author know of a failure case they can relate to? Is Google AI Overviews too similar to the search-vs-AI argument already made?
