# The Front Door and the Escape Hatch — Status

## Current Phase
Analysis ✓ → Author input ✓ → Research next

## Completed
- [x] Analysis (2026-02-18)
- [x] Author input (2026-02-18): all key questions resolved

## In Progress
[None yet]

## Still Needed
- [ ] Research — hybrid products, AI feature adoption data, Norman/affordances evidence, CLI/GUI historical parallel
- [ ] Structure proposal
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Polish

## Resolved Questions
- **Default posture:** UI-first. Settled. The front door is not optional.
- **Hedging concern:** The piece must attack both sides, not reconcile them. "Both are wrong" not "both have a point."
- **Sharpest provocation:** "A chat box is itself a hedge" — chat-first products have no point of view.
- **Audience:** Product people, broadly defined. Everyone is a little bit of a product person.
- **Personal experience:** User-side frustration with chat-first products — no affordances, can't tell what the tool does, functional paralysis. Connects to Norman's Design of Everyday Things.
- **Echo chamber trigger:** A tweet. Specific tweet TBD — may surface during research, or reference vaguely.

## Open Questions
- None blocking. Ready for research.

## Notes
- Strongest asset: the central metaphor and the Devil's Advocate section
- Biggest gap: zero real-world evidence — entirely theoretical right now
- "Chat box as hedge" reframes the hierarchy — UI = opinion, NLP = fallback, chat-first = surrender
- Norman/affordances gives the UI-first stance intellectual grounding — not taste, principle
- The personal experience of bouncing off chat-first products is the emotional hook — everyone has felt this
- Consider cutting the effects lists from 10 items down to 4-5 developed properly
- Tone direction: frustrated participant, not neutral moderator
- The word the author is looking for re: chat-first products might be "alienating" or "indifferent"
