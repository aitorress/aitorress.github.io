# The Front Door and the Escape Hatch — Status

## Current Phase
Analysis ✓ → Research next

## Completed
- [x] Analysis (2026-02-18)

## In Progress
[None yet]

## Still Needed
- [ ] Research — hybrid products shipping today, AI feature adoption data, CLI/GUI historical parallel
- [ ] Author input — personal experience, default posture stance, target audience, echo chamber examples
- [ ] Structure proposal
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Polish

## Open Questions
- Where does the author land on the "default posture" question? (UI-first or AI-first as default?)
- Who is the primary audience? (Product people, designers, or AI engineers?)
- Does the author have personal experience building/using hybrid interfaces?
- How deep should the piece go on the handoff UX — strategic argument or tactical specifics?

## Notes
- Strongest asset: the central metaphor and the Devil's Advocate section
- Biggest gap: zero real-world evidence — entirely theoretical right now
- The "users never find the escape hatch" counterargument is the piece's most interesting tension and needs data to resolve
- Consider cutting the effects lists from 10 items down to 4-5 developed properly
