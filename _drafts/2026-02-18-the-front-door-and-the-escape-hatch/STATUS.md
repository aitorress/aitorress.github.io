## In Progress
[None yet]

## Still Needed
- [ ] Structure proposal (`/draft-structure`)
- [ ] Expansion (`/draft-expand`)
- [ ] Polish (`/draft-polish`)

## Resolved Questions
- **Default posture:** UI-first. Settled. The front door is not optional.
- **Hedging concern:** The piece must attack both sides, not reconcile them. "Both are wrong" not "both have a point."
- **Sharpest provocation:** "A chat box is itself a hedge" — chat-first products have no point of view.
- **Audience:** Product people, broadly defined. Everyone is a little bit of a product person.
- **Personal experience:** User-side frustration with chat-first products — no affordances, can't tell what the tool does, functional paralysis. Connects to Norman's Design of Everyday Things.
- **Echo chamber trigger:** A tweet. Reference vaguely — specific tweet not found.

## Open Questions
- None blocking. Ready for structure.

## Research Highlights (for quick reference)

### Strongest Evidence
- **Amazon Rufus:** Zero users discovered AI features on their own, including daily Amazon users (NN/g study)
- **Adoption-usage gap:** 54.6% of US adults have tried AI, but only 5.7% of work hours involve it. 42% of companies abandoned AI initiatives in 2025.
- **Notion AI:** 50%+ adoption, but they succeeded by embedding AI into existing `/` command patterns — no new interface
- **Copilot:** Inline suggestions (structured, contextual) are unlimited and primary; chat mode is quota-limited and secondary
- **Meta Instagram:** Replaced search with AI chat → immediate backlash, 100K+ likes on criticism videos
- **LinkedIn:** AI-generated questions so generic they became memes → quietly removed

### Key Quotes
- "A theoretical solution to writer's block may have a blank page problem itself." — Smashing Magazine
- "Prompting is essentially like writing a spec." — Linear
- "Don't forget the A — it's artificial. It doesn't understand what it is doing." — Don Norman
- "AI chat is not always the answer." — NN/g
- "91% of AI users reach for their favorite general AI tool for nearly every task." — Menlo Ventures

### Failure Pattern
Products that broke the front door to install AI (Meta, LinkedIn) failed. Products that kept the front door and added AI through existing patterns (Notion, Copilot, Raycast) succeeded. The pattern is clear.

## Notes
- "Chat box as hedge" reframes the hierarchy — UI = opinion, NLP = fallback, chat-first = surrender
- Norman/affordances gives the UI-first stance intellectual grounding — not taste, principle
- The personal experience of bouncing off chat-first products is the emotional hook — everyone has felt this
- Consider cutting the effects lists from 10 items down to 4-5 developed properly
- Tone direction: frustrated participant, not neutral moderator
- The word the author is looking for re: chat-first products might be "alienating" or "indifferent"
- NEW: The CLI/GUI parallel is strongest when noting the irony — developers (who have CLIs) embrace AI; designers (who don't) resist it. The split follows who already has an escape hatch.
