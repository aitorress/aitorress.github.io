# The Front Door and the Escape Hatch — Status

## Current Phase
Analysis ✓ → Author input (partial) ✓ → Research next

## Completed
- [x] Analysis (2026-02-18)
- [x] Author input — partial (2026-02-18): tone, positioning, default posture resolved

## In Progress
[None yet]

## Still Needed
- [ ] Research — hybrid products shipping today, AI feature adoption data, CLI/GUI historical parallel
- [ ] Author input (remaining) — personal experience, target audience, specific echo-chamber examples
- [ ] Structure proposal
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Polish

## Resolved Questions
- **Default posture:** UI-first. Settled. The front door is not optional.
- **Hedging concern:** The piece must attack both sides, not reconcile them. "Both are wrong" not "both have a point."
- **New sharpest provocation:** "A chat box is itself a hedge" — chat-first products have no point of view.

## Open Questions
- Who is the primary audience? (Product people, designers, or AI engineers?)
- Does the author have personal experience building/using hybrid interfaces?
- Which specific bad takes from each side triggered this idea?

## Notes
- Strongest asset: the central metaphor and the Devil's Advocate section
- Biggest gap: zero real-world evidence — entirely theoretical right now
- NEW: "chat box as hedge" reframes the hierarchy — UI = opinion, NLP = fallback, chat-first = surrender
- Consider cutting the effects lists from 10 items down to 4-5 developed properly
- Tone direction: frustrated participant, not neutral moderator
