## In Progress
[None yet]

## Still Needed
- [ ] Polish (`/draft-polish`)

## Resolved Questions
- **Default posture:** UI-first. Settled. The front door is not optional.
- **Hedging concern:** The piece must attack both sides, not reconcile them. "Both are wrong" not "both have a point."
- **Sharpest provocation:** "A chat box is itself a hedge" — chat-first products have no point of view.
- **Audience:** Product people, broadly defined. Everyone is a little bit of a product person.
- **Personal experience:** User-side frustration with chat-first products — no affordances, can't tell what the tool does, functional paralysis. Connects to Norman's Design of Everyday Things.
- **Echo chamber trigger:** A tweet. Referenced vaguely in Section 2.
- **Title:** "A Text Box Is a White Flag" — more provocative, carries the commoditization take. Front-door/escape-hatch stays as internal framework (Section 4).
- **Cold open:** Commoditization observation ("unbrand them, you can't tell the difference"). Personal experience moved to Section 3 Beat 2.

## Open Questions
- None blocking. Ready for polish.

## Article Stats
- Word count: ~1,500
- Sections: 7 (5 with headings, 2 without)
- Links: 4 (NN/g Rufus, St. Louis Fed, Menlo Ventures, Linear)
- External quotes: Smashing Magazine, Linear, Fortune

## Notes
- Tone landed as frustrated participant, not neutral moderator
- Norman section weaves in naturally (Section 3, Beat 3) rather than lecturing
- Commoditization open ("unbrand them") is the strongest hook — immediate and verifiable
- The front-door/escape-hatch framework arrives in Section 4 (mid-piece) rather than leading
- Close is tight: 3 sentences + "Start there."
