# The Unbundling of Work: Why AI Won't Kill Your Job, Just Reorganize It

## The Seed

Jobs are not single, indivisible entities. They're bundles of tasks—teaching, researching, writing, filling out reports, admin work, drafting correspondence. The job title is just a label; the daily grind consists of this mix of activities. Can AI take over these tasks? Yes. And frankly, there are some I wouldn't mind offloading—the busywork, the soul-crushing administrivia. But does that mean my job will vanish? Not really. Eliminating some tasks doesn't mean the job disappears. Power tools didn't eliminate carpenters; they made them more efficient.

## Steel Man

The strongest version of this argument draws on economic history and the nature of occupational structure:

**The task-based view of labor is empirically correct.** Economists like David Autor have documented that jobs aren't automated wholesale—specific tasks within jobs are. Data entry disappeared from many roles, but the roles didn't. Spreadsheets eliminated entire categories of calculation work, but accountants still exist (and do higher-value analysis).

**Automation has historically been task-substituting, not job-eliminating.** The ATM was supposed to kill bank tellers. Instead, it reduced the cost of opening branches, banks opened more branches, and teller employment actually *grew* for decades—but the job shifted from cash handling to relationship management and sales.

**Comparative advantage applies within jobs, not just between them.** If AI handles your report formatting and email drafting, you don't become useless—you become concentrated on whatever you do better than AI. The job reshapes around your remaining comparative advantages.

**The power tools analogy is historically precise.** Pneumatic nail guns, circular saws, and laser levels didn't eliminate carpenters. Construction employment grew. What changed was throughput, precision, and which parts of carpentry required human judgment versus mechanical execution.

## Devil's Advocate

Here's where this breaks down:

**Some jobs really are just bundles of automatable tasks.** If a job is 90% routine information processing and 10% edge cases, once AI handles both, what's left? The "kernel" of irreducible human value might be too small to constitute a job. Radiologists, for instance, aren't just reading scans—but what if scan-reading was 80% of the role's economic value?

**Task elimination can lead to job consolidation, not job preservation.** If AI handles the administrative tasks that used to require three people, you might get one person plus AI, not three more efficient people. The *job title* survives, but employment in that role shrinks.

**The power tools analogy has a survivor bias problem.** Carpentry survived automation, but plenty of trades didn't—or shrank dramatically. Elevator operators, telephone switchboard operators, typists as a standalone profession. The question isn't whether *some* jobs survive task automation, but whether *yours* will.

**Speed of transition matters.** Power tools diffused over decades. If AI compresses the same transformation into 5 years, the "jobs reorganize" story might be technically true but socially catastrophic—people can't retrain that fast.

## First-Order Effects

If this "task unbundling" view is correct, here's what happens immediately:

1. **Performance variance within jobs increases.** People who are good at the remaining non-automated tasks pull ahead; those who were coasting on the automatable parts get exposed.

2. **Job descriptions become more fluid.** If "writing reports" gets automated but "interpreting findings for clients" doesn't, the latter expands to fill the time. Job scope creeps toward whatever AI can't do.

3. **Hiring criteria shift.** You stop hiring for "can do all parts of this job" and start hiring for "excellent at the parts AI can't do." This favors specialists over generalists in some domains, but favors integrators who can orchestrate AI in others.

4. **Busywork becomes a competitive disadvantage.** Organizations that don't offload automatable tasks to AI will simply be outproduced by those that do. This isn't optional adaptation; it's competitive necessity.

5. **Middle management gets squeezed first.** A lot of middle management is coordination, information aggregation, and report synthesis—exactly the tasks AI handles well. The first major job *category* to face real pressure might be "people who summarize things for other people."

## Second-Order Effects

The downstream implications are where this gets genuinely weird:

**The "job" as a unit of economic organization may start dissolving.** If tasks can be unbundled and some given to AI, why not unbundle further? You might see more project-based work, more fractional roles, more people with portfolios of task-bundles rather than single "jobs." The job title becomes even more of a fiction.

**Training and education get disrupted.** If jobs are task bundles, and the task mix is shifting, then training people for "jobs" makes less sense than training them for "tasks that AI can't do"—which is a moving target. Curriculum becomes obsolete faster.

**Status hierarchies get scrambled.** A lot of professional prestige comes from doing tasks that are hard and rare. If AI makes those tasks easy, does the prestige transfer to the remaining hard tasks, or does the whole profession lose status? Doctors who mostly diagnose vs. doctors who mostly hold hands through difficult decisions—same title, very different status in an AI world.

**New jobs emerge around AI orchestration.** "Prompt engineer" is a joke job title today, but the underlying skill—knowing how to direct AI to do task-bundles effectively—becomes a real competency. The meta-job of "AI task manager" becomes a role.

**Surveillance and measurement intensify.** If jobs are task bundles, and AI can do some tasks, then someone needs to measure which tasks humans are actually doing and whether they're doing them well. Expect more granular productivity monitoring, with all the dystopian potential that implies.

## The Tension You're Sensing

You're really asking: **"Am I more than the sum of my tasks?"**

The optimistic read of your argument is that humans have irreducible value beyond task execution—judgment, creativity, relationships, adaptation. The job survives because the human at its core survives.

But there's a darker version lurking: what if you're *not* more than your tasks? What if the "human element" is smaller than you think, and most of what you do is pattern-matching that AI will eventually replicate?

The carpenter analogy is comforting because carpenters clearly have embodied skill, spatial judgment, and problem-solving that power tools assist but don't replace. But a lot of knowledge work might be more like the switchboard operator than the carpenter—a job that exists because humans were the only technology available, not because the task inherently requires humanity.

You're circling the question of whether your job has a *kernel of irreducible humanness* or whether it's *tasks all the way down*.

## Questions Worth Exploring

1. **What percentage of your current job is "busywork" you'd happily offload?** If it's over 50%, what does the remaining job actually look like? Is it still a job, or is it a hobby with a salary?

2. **Inversion: What tasks do you do that AI *should* be able to do but currently can't?** That's your 2-5 year risk zone.

3. **Who benefits from the "jobs are task bundles" framing?** Employers who want to automate tasks while keeping headcount pressure on workers? Workers who want to argue they're still valuable? Both?

4. **Historical parallel: What happened to jobs that were *partially* automated but not eliminated?** Did the humans doing them become more or less satisfied? More or less paid?

5. **What's the minimum viable task-bundle that constitutes a "job" in your field?** At what point does task-shedding turn a job into a gig?

6. **If AI handles 60% of your tasks, do you get paid the same for the remaining 40%?** The economic logic suggests no—unless the 40% is dramatically more valuable.

7. **Are there tasks you *don't want* to offload because doing them is part of why the job is meaningful?** The busywork framing assumes all automated tasks are unwanted. Is that true?

## Raw Material

- "Your job title is a label; your job is a bundle of tasks wearing that label."

- "Power tools didn't kill carpenters. They killed the version of carpentry that was mostly sawing. The carpenters who remained became designers who happened to use wood."

- "The question isn't whether AI can do your job. It's whether AI can do enough of your tasks that the remaining ones don't add up to full-time employment."

- "Jobs don't disappear; they deflate. The title stays, the headcount shrinks, the survivors do what AI can't."

- "Middle management is, in large part, the human API layer between people who make decisions and people who implement them. AI is a very efficient API."

- "We've been automating tasks for centuries. What's new isn't automation—it's the speed and the scope. The carpenter had decades to adapt. You might have years."

- "The optimist says: I'll do the interesting parts and AI will do the boring parts. The pessimist asks: what if someone else's interesting parts were your job?"

## Next Steps

1. **Audit your own task bundle.** Spend a week tracking what you actually do, categorized by "AI could do this now," "AI could do this in 2 years," and "probably still needs me." Be honest. The percentage breakdown will either reassure or alarm you.

2. **Research what happened to bank tellers post-ATM, specifically.** The story is more nuanced than "they survived"—dig into how the job changed, what happened to wages, and whether the people who were tellers before ATMs were the same people who were tellers after.

3. **Write the counter-post: "Jobs *Are* Indivisible, Actually."** Try to argue that the task-bundle framing misses something essential about how work creates identity, relationships, and institutional knowledge. If you can't write that post convincingly, you'll know your original take is solid.
