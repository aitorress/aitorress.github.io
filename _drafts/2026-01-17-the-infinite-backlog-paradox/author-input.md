# Author Input: The Infinite Backlog Paradox

## Session: 2026-01-26

### Author's Position

**Core stance:** AI will transform jobs, not reduce them. The "infinite backlog" framing is technically true but misses the real constraint.

**The key insight:** The bottleneck isn't building—it's *caring*. Even if you could technically have an infinite backlog, care gets diluted as scope expands. People will pay for others to **own** specific, **finite** parts of the work. Ownership is the scarce resource, not engineering capacity.

**Hot take:** "AI won't reduce the number of jobs!"

### Personal Experience

No single defining story, but a recurring pattern: You deliberately don't want to build a swiss army knife. The work is intentionally finite. But because it's finite, you start questioning whether all the teams, scrum masters, engineers, and product owners are justified—and what happens to them once it's harder to justify more work on the project.

The tension: work *should* be finite (you don't want scope creep), but finite work makes people nervous about their roles.

### Open Questions

**The "missing rung" problem:** Author honestly doesn't know. This remains an open question—worth acknowledging in the piece rather than forcing a take.

### What to Emphasize

- **Ownership over output.** The fresh angle: as AI makes building cheaper, the valuable thing becomes *caring about* and *owning* a piece of work. This is what people will pay for.
- **Finite is good.** The infinite backlog isn't desirable. Well-scoped, finite work is the goal. The question is what happens to people when the finite work is done.
- **Transformation, not elimination.** Jobs shift; they don't disappear.

### Raw Quotes (paraphrased from author)

- "The infinite backlog doesn't exist. At some point, if the backlog keeps increasing, the people owning the work care less and less about it."
- "People will start paying for people to care and own specific and FINITE parts of the work."
- "You definitely don't want to build a swiss army knife—you know the work is finite."
- "AI won't reduce the number of jobs!"

### Implications for the Piece

1. **Reframe the paradox:** It's not "infinite demand vs. finite demand." It's "building vs. owning." AI makes building cheap; ownership stays expensive.

2. **The "care" angle is new:** This isn't in the current draft and could be the differentiating thesis. The backlog isn't constrained by engineering capacity—it's constrained by how much anyone can genuinely care about.

3. **Acknowledge the junior engineer question honestly:** Don't force a take. "I don't know" is a valid position if framed well.

4. **The finite-work anxiety:** There's a real tension between "scope should be finite" and "finite scope threatens jobs." This is worth exploring.
