# Structure: Care Doesn't Scale

**Date:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Approved

**Title:** Care Doesn't Scale
**Include historical numbers:** Yes (400K clerks, 600K accountants)
**Junior uncertainty:** Acknowledge honestly

## Core Argument

The AI-and-jobs debate is stuck on the wrong question. It's not "will demand be infinite or finite?" — it's "who will *own* the work?" AI makes building cheap, but ownership stays expensive. The scarce resource isn't engineering capacity; it's caring.

## Piece Type

**Tension-driven** — Challenges both the "mass layoffs" and "infinite demand" narratives by exposing what they both miss.

## Headings

**Yes** — The piece has three distinct moves (setup → twist → reframe) and will likely run 900-1100 words. Section breaks will help readers track the argument. Recommend 2-3 headings to mark major turns.

---

## Proposed Outline

### 1. The Setup (No heading — opening)

**Purpose:** Establish the standard AI narrative and the "infinite backlog" counter-argument that supposedly refutes it.

**Content:**
- Open with the standard take: AI supercharges engineers, so you need fewer. Simple math.
- But there's a counter: what if demand is elastic? What if there's always more to build?
- Historical evidence suggests this is right: ATMs didn't kill teller jobs (initially), spreadsheets grew accounting employment.
- Jevons Paradox: make something cheaper, get more of it.

**Sources:** Draft opening + historical employment research + Jevons research

**Estimated length:** 2-3 paragraphs (~200 words)

### 2. "But Wait" — The Twist

**Heading suggestion:** *"The Backlog Is a Graveyard"* or *"Care Doesn't Scale"*

**Purpose:** Undercut the "infinite demand" thesis you just presented. Show that it's technically true but misses the point.

**Content:**
- The Steel Man against infinite demand: most backlog items are political theater, pet projects, things no one would actually use
- Even if you *could* build infinitely, care gets diluted. Who owns the work?
- You don't *want* a swiss army knife. Finite scope is good. The tension: finite scope threatens jobs.
- The BCG study finding: AI helps, but only inside its "frontier." Outside the frontier, it *hurts*. The skill isn't "use AI" — it's knowing where the line is.

**Sources:** Draft Steel Man + author input (ownership/care angle) + BCG/Mollick research

**Estimated length:** 3-4 paragraphs (~300 words)

---

### 3. The Reframe — Building vs. Owning

**Heading suggestion:** *"The Real Bottleneck"* or *"Ownership Is the Scarce Resource"*

**Purpose:** Deliver the core insight. Shift from "will there be jobs?" to "what will jobs become?"

**Content:**
- The framing is wrong. It's not infinite vs. finite demand. It's *building* vs. *owning*.
- AI makes building cheap. But someone still has to care. Someone still has to own a finite piece of work and be accountable for it.
- The "jagged frontier" finding connects here: the valuable skill is knowing what AI can and can't do. That judgment is itself a form of ownership.
- Historical pattern: automation eliminates *tasks*, not jobs. Tellers became relationship managers. Clerks became analysts. The job title survives; the tasks change.

**Sources:** Author input (key insight) + BCG research (jagged frontier) + historical research (task elimination pattern)

**Estimated length:** 3-4 paragraphs (~300 words)

---

### 4. The Close (No heading — landing)

**Purpose:** Leave the reader with the practical takeaway and the author's stance.

**Content:**
- Author's hot take: "AI won't reduce the number of jobs."
- But it will change what jobs *are*. The question is whether you're positioned to own something.
- Optional: Acknowledge the "missing rung" uncertainty honestly. We don't know yet what happens to juniors.
- Close on ownership: The backlog isn't the bottleneck. Care is. The people who survive the shift are the ones who own a piece of work someone cares about.

**Sources:** Author input (hot take + honest uncertainty) + synthesis

**Estimated length:** 2 paragraphs (~150 words)

---

## Target Length

~900-1100 words (matches published posts like "Still Handy")

---

## What's Not Included

| Cut | Reason |
|-----|--------|
| Full "Adjacent Ideas" section | Reference material, not reader content. Use 1-2 references inline. |
| 7 "Questions Worth Exploring" | Too many open questions dilute the argument. One acknowledged uncertainty (juniors) is enough. |
| "Next Steps" section | Author workflow, not article content. |
| "Product vs. infrastructure" framing | Replaced by "building vs. owning" which is sharper and came from author input. |
| Second-order effects (technical debt, geographic arbitrage, etc.) | Interesting but tangential to the new core thesis. Could be a separate piece. |
| Detailed Jevons Paradox numbers | One line reference is enough; don't over-explain. |

## Open Questions for Author

1. **Title?** The current title "The Infinite Backlog Paradox" sets up the old framing. Alternatives:
   - "The Ownership Bottleneck"
   - "Care Doesn't Scale"
   - "Building vs. Owning"
   - Keep the original (the "paradox" is that the paradox is wrong)

2. **How explicit on the "I don't know" for juniors?** Include a line or two, or leave it out entirely?

3. **Include historical numbers?** (400K fewer clerks, 600K more accountants) or keep it vaguer?

## Alternative Structures Considered

**Option B: Lead with the insight**
- Open with "The debate is wrong" and then show why
- Risk: loses the setup/payoff arc; feels more like an essay than an argument

**Option C: Personal narrative frame**
- Anchor in a specific experience with backlogs
- Risk: author said no strong single story; would feel forced

**Chosen: Option A (above)** — Setup → Twist → Reframe follows the natural discovery arc and matches the author's published voice pattern.
