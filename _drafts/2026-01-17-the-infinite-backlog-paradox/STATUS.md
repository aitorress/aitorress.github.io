## Open Questions
1. ~~Does historical data actually support "infinite demand"?~~ **ANSWERED:** Yes, with nuance. ATMs/spreadsheets show job *transformation* not elimination. But delayed effects are real (teller jobs declining now, 40 years later).
2. The "missing rung" problem — research found AI is a "skill leveler" (helps weak performers more). Unclear if this helps or hurts junior development.
3. **New:** Homogenization risk — AI outputs are higher quality but less varied. Does this commoditize work?

## Key Decisions Made
- **Thesis:** AI transforms jobs, doesn't reduce them. Clear stance, not both-sides.
- **Fresh angle:** "Ownership over output" — the bottleneck isn't building, it's *caring*. People pay for others to own finite parts of work.
- **Hot take:** "AI won't reduce the number of jobs!"

## Key Decisions Pending
- **Scope:** Focus on engineers specifically, or broaden to knowledge work?
- **Structure:** How to integrate the ownership/care angle with the existing product-vs-infrastructure framing?

## Notes
**New insight from author input:** The infinite backlog is technically possible but misses the point. Care gets diluted as scope grows. The scarce resource is ownership, not engineering capacity. This reframes the whole piece: it's not "infinite vs. finite demand"—it's "building vs. owning."

Also surfaced: there's tension between "finite scope is good" (you don't want swiss army knife) and "finite scope threatens jobs." Worth exploring.

## Research Synthesis (2026-01-26)

**Historical data supports the thesis** but with important caveats:
- ATMs: Tellers per branch ↓, but total branches ↑, so jobs held steady. Role transformed to "relationship management."
- Spreadsheets: 400K fewer clerks, but 600K more accountants. Net positive.
- **Key pattern:** Automation eliminates *tasks*, not jobs. Jobs transform toward higher-skill versions.

**Jevons Paradox is real** but applies to *output*, not *employment*:
- Coal consumption 16x despite 4x population (Jevons, 1865)
- Modern: efficiency ↑36%, consumption ↑63% since 1990
- Software analogy: more software gets built, but unclear if more engineers are needed

**BCG/Harvard study provides the empirical anchor:**
- 40%+ quality improvement on tasks inside AI's frontier
- 19% *worse* on tasks outside the frontier
- AI is a "skill leveler" (helps weak performers more)
- Output homogenization: higher quality but less varied

**The "jagged frontier" concept connects to author's "ownership" angle:**
- Knowing where the frontier lies = the valuable skill
- This *is* a form of ownership—owning the judgment about what AI can/can't do
