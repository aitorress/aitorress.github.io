# The Infinite Backlog Paradox — Status

## Current Phase
Research

## Completed
- [x] Analysis (2026-01-26)
- [x] Author input (2026-01-26)

## In Progress
None

## Still Needed
- [ ] Research: Historical employment data post-productivity-tools
- [ ] Research: Jevons Paradox specifics
- [ ] Research: AI productivity distribution (BCG, Mollick)
- [ ] Structure proposal
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Polish

## Open Questions
1. Does historical data actually support "infinite demand"? (Research will answer)
2. The "missing rung" problem (juniors displaced → where do seniors come from?) — author doesn't have a firm view, will acknowledge openly

## Key Decisions Made
- **Thesis:** AI transforms jobs, doesn't reduce them. Clear stance, not both-sides.
- **Fresh angle:** "Ownership over output" — the bottleneck isn't building, it's *caring*. People pay for others to own finite parts of work.
- **Hot take:** "AI won't reduce the number of jobs!"

## Key Decisions Pending
- **Scope:** Focus on engineers specifically, or broaden to knowledge work?
- **Structure:** How to integrate the ownership/care angle with the existing product-vs-infrastructure framing?

## Notes
**New insight from author input:** The infinite backlog is technically possible but misses the point. Care gets diluted as scope grows. The scarce resource is ownership, not engineering capacity. This reframes the whole piece: it's not "infinite vs. finite demand"—it's "building vs. owning."

Also surfaced: there's tension between "finite scope is good" (you don't want swiss army knife) and "finite scope threatens jobs." Worth exploring.
