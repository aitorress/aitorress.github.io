## Current Phase
Analysis

## Completed
- [x] Analysis (2026-01-26)

## In Progress
None

## Still Needed
- [ ] Research: Historical employment data post-productivity-tools
- [ ] Research: Jevons Paradox specifics
- [ ] Research: AI productivity distribution (BCG, Mollick)
- [ ] Author input: Position on thesis, personal experience, audience
- [ ] Structure proposal
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Polish

## Open Questions
1. Does historical data actually support "infinite demand"? (Research will answer)
2. What's the author's actual position—genuinely uncertain or leaning one way?
3. Who is the target audience for this piece?
4. How to handle the short-term vs. long-term timeframe distinction?

## Key Decisions Pending
- **Thesis commitment:** Present both sides equally, or argue for one?
- **Scope:** Focus on engineers specifically, or broaden to knowledge work?
- **Political economy:** Include or save for another piece?

## Notes
Core framing ("product vs. infrastructure") is strong. Steel man and devil's advocate are both well-developed. Main gap is empirical grounding—need historical data to make the argument land. Author input needed on stance and personal experience.
