# Research: AI Productivity Studies (BCG/Harvard, Mollick)

*Research date: 2026-01-26*

## Summary

The BCG/Harvard study provides the best empirical data on AI productivity in knowledge work. Key finding: AI delivers massive gains (40%+ quality improvement) for tasks *inside* its capability frontier, but actually *harms* performance for tasks outside it. The "jagged frontier" concept is crucial—AI capabilities are uneven and non-intuitive. Also important: AI acts as a "skill leveler," helping weaker performers more than strong ones.

## Key Findings

### The BCG/Harvard Study (2023)

**Study design:**
- 758 Boston Consulting Group consultants (7% of IC-level consultants company-wide)
- Pre-registered experiment with three conditions: no AI, GPT-4 access, GPT-4 + prompt engineering training
- Tasks designed to reflect realistic consulting work

**Results for tasks INSIDE the frontier:**
- Consultants completed 12.2% more tasks
- Completed tasks 25.1% faster
- Quality improved by more than 40%
- 90% of participants improved performance on creative/ideation tasks

**Results for tasks OUTSIDE the frontier:**
- Consultants using AI were 19 percentage points LESS likely to produce correct solutions
- AI actively harmed performance on tasks it couldn't handle well

- **Credibility:** Very high—peer-reviewed, large sample, real professional context
- **How to use:** This is the empirical anchor for the piece. Cite specific numbers.

### The "Jagged Technological Frontier"

**The concept:**
- AI capabilities don't form a smooth gradient from easy to hard
- The frontier is "jagged"—like a fortress wall with towers jutting out and others folding back
- Some seemingly complex tasks are easy for AI; some seemingly simple tasks are hard
- The wall is *invisible*—you can't predict which side a task falls on without testing

**The implication:**
"Unless you use AI a lot, you won't know which is which."

- **Source:** [Mollick: Centaurs and Cyborgs on the Jagged Frontier](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged)
- **How to use:** This concept directly supports your "ownership" angle—knowing where the frontier lies IS the valuable skill

### The Skill-Leveling Effect

**Finding:** AI helped weaker performers more than strong ones.
- Below-average consultants: 43% improvement
- Above-average consultants: 17% improvement

**Implication:** AI compresses the skill distribution. This has implications for the "missing rung" problem—if AI helps juniors perform like seniors, does that eliminate the training ground or accelerate it?

- **How to use:** Connects to your open question about junior engineers

### Centaurs and Cyborgs

**Two successful integration patterns emerged:**

1. **Centaurs:** Strategically divide labor—some tasks to AI, some to themselves. Clear boundaries between human and AI work.

2. **Cyborgs:** Completely integrate with AI at a granular level. Continuous interaction, no clear division.

Both patterns worked, but they're different skills.

- **How to use:** The skill isn't just "using AI"—it's knowing HOW to integrate, which requires understanding the jagged frontier

### Output Homogenization

**Finding:** AI-assisted outputs were higher quality but less varied.
- Ideas generated with AI had less variability than human-only ideas
- "While GPT-4 aids in generating superior content, it might lead to more homogenized outputs"

- **How to use:** Possible counterpoint—if everyone uses AI, does output become commoditized? Does this support or undermine the "ownership" thesis?

## Counterpoints or Complications

1. **The study is from 2023 with GPT-4.** AI capabilities are evolving rapidly. The frontier is shifting.

2. **Consultants ≠ engineers.** The tasks tested were consulting tasks (ideation, analysis). Software engineering tasks might have different frontier patterns.

3. **The skill-leveling effect cuts both ways.** If AI compresses skill differences, does that *increase* or *decrease* demand for human expertise?

4. **Homogenization is a real risk.** If AI-assisted work becomes uniform, the differentiator becomes non-AI contributions—which might reduce total demand for AI-augmented workers.

## Gaps in Research

- No longitudinal data—what happens after 6 months of AI use?
- No software engineering-specific studies at this scale
- Unclear how quickly workers learn to identify the frontier
- No data on organizational-level effects (team composition, hiring changes)

## Raw Quotes

> "For each one of a set of 18 realistic consulting tasks within the frontier of AI capabilities, consultants using AI were significantly more productive... and produced significantly higher quality results (more than 40% higher quality compared to a control group)."

> "For a task selected to be outside the frontier, however, consultants using AI were 19 percentage points less likely to produce correct solutions."

> "The lowest performers among the group had the biggest gains when using generative AI."

> "On some tasks AI is immensely powerful, and on others it fails completely or subtly. And, unless you use AI a lot, you won't know which is which." — Ethan Mollick

> "While GPT-4 aids in generating superior content, it might lead to more homogenized outputs."
