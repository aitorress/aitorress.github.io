# Research: Jevons Paradox

*Research date: 2026-01-26*

## Summary

Jevons Paradox is well-documented historically and continues to hold in modern energy data. The mechanism (efficiency → lower cost → increased consumption) is robust. However, applying it to software engineering requires care—the paradox describes *resource consumption*, not *employment*. The analogy works for "how much software gets built" but not directly for "how many engineers are needed."

## Key Findings

### Original Historical Data

**The origin (1865):**
- William Stanley Jevons observed that James Watt's improved steam engine (more efficient coal use) led to *increased* total coal consumption, not decreased
- Jevons documented: "In round numbers, the population has about quadrupled since the beginning of the nineteenth century, but the consumption of coal has increased sixteenfold, and more."
- British coal consumption tripled by 1900

**The mechanism:**
- Efficiency makes energy cheaper per unit of output
- Cheaper energy enables "new modes of economy" (Jevons's phrase)—new uses that weren't economical before
- Total consumption rises even as per-unit consumption falls

- **Source:** [Yale Energy History: The Coal Question](https://energyhistory.yale.edu/w-stanley-jevons-the-coal-question-1865/)
- **Credibility:** High—primary historical source, widely cited
- **How to use:** Anchor the "infinite demand" argument in established economic principle

### Modern Data

**Energy efficiency vs. consumption (global):**
- Since 1990: energy efficiency up 36%, total consumption up 63%
- 2010: 153,125 TWh global energy consumption
- 2023: 183,230 TWh (20% increase in 13 years despite efficiency gains)
- Over 60 years: efficiency improved 40%, demand per capita nearly doubled, total demand quadrupled

**Specific examples:**
- Los Angeles: 10,000 horses in 1900 → 1 million cars by 1950
- Data centers now consume 1.5% of global electricity despite increasingly efficient chips
- "Three centuries of energy-efficiency backfire: as heat engines grew more efficient, humanity consumed more fossil fuels"

- **Credibility:** High—based on global energy statistics
- **How to use:** Show the pattern isn't just historical—it's ongoing

### The Mechanism (Rebound Effects)

1. **Direct rebound:** Efficiency makes the resource cheaper to use → you use more of it for existing purposes
2. **Indirect rebound:** Savings from efficiency get spent elsewhere, often on things that also consume the resource
3. **Transformational effect:** Efficiency enables entirely new applications that weren't feasible before

When rebound exceeds 100%, you get Jevons Paradox (also called "backfire").

## Counterpoints or Complications

1. **Jevons describes resource consumption, not employment.** Coal consumption increased, but coal *mining jobs* eventually peaked and declined. The paradox says "more software gets built," not "more engineers get hired."

2. **Saturation can occur.** Jevons Paradox isn't infinite—at some point, demand for a resource can saturate. The question is whether we're near that point for software.

3. **The draft's Steel Man addresses this.** "Jevons Paradox has limits... There's a ceiling on how much software any organization actually needs." This is the crux of the debate.

4. **AI might be different.** Previous efficiency gains (coal, computing) expanded *what was possible*. AI might expand *who can build*—potentially saturating the market with lower-quality output rather than expanding high-quality demand.

## Gaps in Research

- No direct studies applying Jevons Paradox to software development specifically
- Unclear where "saturation" occurs for different resource types
- Missing: examples where Jevons Paradox *didn't* hold (selection bias in citing it)

> "In round numbers, the population has about quadrupled since the beginning of the nineteenth century, but the consumption of coal has increased sixteenfold, and more." — Jevons, 1865

> "The reason efficiency backfires, Jevons reasoned, is that it stimulates what he called 'new modes of economy'. In other words, efficiency catalyzes technological sprawl."

> "Since 1990, energy efficiency has increased 36% and total energy consumption has increased 63%."
