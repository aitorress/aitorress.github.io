# Research: Historical Employment After Productivity Tools

*Research date: 2026-01-26*

## Summary

Historical evidence strongly supports the "job transformation" thesis over the "job elimination" thesis. Both ATMs and spreadsheets initially preserved or grew employment, though the mechanism was *task transformation* rather than pure demand expansion. The key pattern: automation eliminates routine tasks, not jobs—and this creates demand for higher-skilled versions of the same role.

## Key Findings

### ATMs and Bank Tellers

**The paradox:** ATMs were introduced in the 1970s. In 1973, the New York Times predicted ATMs would replace "up to 75 percent" of tellers. Instead, teller employment *increased*.

**The numbers:**
- Tellers per branch fell from 20 to 13 between 1988 and 2004
- But banks opened 43% more branches in urban areas
- 472,000 bank tellers in 2018—a 10% increase since 2000
- Number of tellers today is roughly the same as in 1990

**Why it happened:**
1. ATMs reduced per-branch operating costs → banks opened more branches to compete for market share
2. Teller role transformed: "The ATM machine effectively changed the job of the bank teller into one where they are more of a marketing person. They are part of what banks call the 'customer relationship team.'"

**The catch:** This is changing now. The Labor Department projects teller employment to decline 8% over the next decade due to mobile/online banking. "ATMs didn't reduce tellers, but today's tech will."

- **Credibility:** High—based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data
- **How to use:** Lead example for "productivity tools don't eliminate jobs" argument, but note the delayed effect caveat

### Spreadsheets and Accountants

**The numbers:**
- 400,000 *fewer* accounting clerks since 1980
- 600,000 *more* regular accountants
- Net: +200,000 accounting jobs despite automation

**Why it happened:**
- VisiCalc (1979) "turned 20 hours of manual calculation into 15 minutes of automated work"
- Routine clerical tasks automated away, but demand for analytical accounting increased
- "Crunching numbers had become cheaper, more versatile, and more powerful, so demand went up"

**The transformation:**
- Tim Hartford: "In the age of the spreadsheet, the repetitive, routine parts of accountancy disappeared"
- But spreadsheets "created whole new industries—for example, scenario-crunching math modeling for high finance"

- **Credibility:** Medium-high—based on Tim Hartford citing Planet Money research
- **How to use:** Second example showing the pattern isn't unique to ATMs

## Counterpoints or Complications

1. **Delayed effects matter.** ATMs didn't kill teller jobs for 40 years—but now they're declining. The "infinite demand" argument might just be describing a lag, not a permanent state.

2. **The shift is to *different* jobs.** Fewer clerks, more accountants. Fewer routine tellers, more relationship managers. The total numbers held, but the people displaced weren't always the ones who filled the new roles.

3. **Both examples predate AI.** Spreadsheets and ATMs automated *routine* tasks. AI potentially automates *cognitive* tasks. The analogy may not hold.

4. **Selection bias in examples.** We cite ATMs and spreadsheets because they *didn't* eliminate jobs. What about cases where automation *did* reduce employment (e.g., manufacturing)?

## Gaps in Research

- No longitudinal data on *individual* workers—did the displaced clerks become accountants, or were they different people?
- Missing comparison to manufacturing automation, where job losses were more severe
- No data on how long the "demand expansion" phase lasted before saturation

## Raw Quotes

> "The ATM machine effectively changed the job of the bank teller into one where they are more of a marketing person."

> "Sometimes automation creates jobs and sometimes it destroys them. The point is that automation reshapes the workplace in much subtler ways than 'a robot took my job'."

> "In the age of the spreadsheet, the repetitive, routine parts of accountancy disappeared."

> "Crunching numbers had become cheaper, more versatile, and more powerful, so demand went up."
