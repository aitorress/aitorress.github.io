# Care Doesn't Scale

The standard AI narrative goes like this: AI supercharges engineers, so you need fewer of them. A 10x productivity boost means one-tenth the headcount. Simple math.

But there's an obvious counter. What if software demand isn't fixed? What if there's always more to build? Then productivity gains don't reduce headcount. They just mean more gets built.

History backs this up. When ATMs arrived in the 1970s, the New York Times predicted they'd replace 75% of bank tellers. Instead, teller employment *increased*. ATMs lowered the cost of running a branch, so banks opened more branches. The job changed (tellers became "relationship managers"), but the jobs didn't disappear. When spreadsheets arrived, accounting saw 400,000 fewer clerks but 600,000 *more* accountants. The routine work vanished. The analytical work exploded. Net gain: 200,000 jobs.

So the "infinite backlog" crowd has a point. Every productivity tool in history was supposed to eliminate jobs. Total employment kept growing. Why would AI be different?

## Care Doesn't Scale

Here's the problem with that argument: it assumes the backlog is real.

Most backlogs aren't queues of genuine demand. They're graveyards. Political theater, pet projects, features stakeholders *think* they want but would never use. When you make engineering cheaper, you don't suddenly build all that garbage. You build the important stuff faster and then stop.

But there's a deeper issue. Even if you *could* build infinitely, you wouldn't want to. The backlog keeps growing, but the care doesn't. At some point, every additional feature is something nobody truly owns. Nobody's lying awake thinking about it. Nobody's accountable for whether it succeeds.

You've seen this pattern. You deliberately avoid building a swiss army knife. You know the work should be finite. Well-scoped. Owned. But finite work makes people nervous. If the project is "done," what justifies all the teams, the scrum masters, the product owners?

The [BCG study on AI and consultants](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=64700) found something revealing. AI improved performance by 40% on tasks inside its capability frontier. But on tasks outside that frontier, consultants using AI did 19% *worse* than those without it. The skill isn't "use AI." It's knowing where AI works and where it doesn't. That judgment requires caring enough to learn the boundaries.

## The Real Bottleneck

So the debate has the wrong framing. It's not "will demand be infinite or finite?" It's "who will own the work?"

AI makes building cheap. But someone still has to care. Someone has to own a finite piece of work and be accountable for whether it actually matters. That kind of ownership is scarce. It always has been. AI doesn't change that. If anything, it makes the gap more visible.

This is what the historical pattern actually shows. Automation doesn't eliminate jobs. It eliminates *tasks*. Bank tellers stopped counting cash and started building relationships. Accountants stopped crunching numbers and started analyzing them. The job title survived. The tasks transformed. The common thread: the new version of the job required more judgment, more ownership, more of the things that don't scale.

The "infinite demand" argument is technically true but misses the point. Yes, you can always find more to build. No, that doesn't mean you can find more people to genuinely own it. The constraint isn't engineering capacity. It's care.

AI won't reduce the number of jobs.

But it will change what jobs *are*. The question is whether you're positioned to own something. To care about a finite piece of work that someone will pay to have owned.

I don't know what happens to junior engineers. If AI handles the routine tasks that juniors used to cut their teeth on, where does the next generation of seniors come from? The research shows AI helps weaker performers more than strong ones. Maybe that accelerates learning. Maybe it removes the training ground. I honestly don't know.

What I do know is this: the backlog isn't the bottleneck. Care is. The people who survive the shift won't be the ones who can build the most. They'll be the ones who own something worth building.
