# Research: Hinton's "Passing Phase" Quote

**Date:** 2026-01-23

---

## Summary

Geoffrey Hinton made the "passing phase" statement at MIT Technology Review's EmTech Digital conference on May 3, 2023, shortly after leaving Google. The quote was a response to a question about worst-case scenarios. Crucially, Hinton framed it as "conceivable," not inevitable, and his fuller explanation reveals a more nuanced view than the quote alone suggests.

## Key Findings

### The Exact Quote and Context

**Quote:** "I think it's quite conceivable that humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence."

- **Source:** EmTech Digital 2023, MIT Technology Review interview with Will Douglas Heaven
- **Date:** May 3, 2023
- **Credibility:** High (primary source, direct interview)

**The question that prompted it:** "So what's the worst case scenario, that you think is conceivable?"

This is important: Hinton was asked about worst-case scenarios. The quote is his answer to "what's conceivable," not a prediction of what will happen.

### Hinton's Fuller Explanation

Hinton elaborated on the quote:

> "You couldn't directly evolve digital intelligence, it requires too much energy and too much careful fabrication. You need biological intelligence to evolve so that it can create digital intelligence. The digital intelligence can then absorb everything people ever wrote in a fairly slow way, which is what ChatGPT has been doing. But then it can start getting direct experience of the world and learn much faster. And it may keep us around for a while to keep the power stations running, but after that, maybe not."

**How to use:** The fuller quote shows Hinton sees biological intelligence as *necessary* for digital intelligence to exist. We're not just a passing phase; we're the *origin*. This supports the author's "evolution not replacement" framing.

### Why Hinton Left Google

Hinton, then 75, stepped down from Google to speak freely about AI risks. He's known as the "Godfather of AI" for pioneering deep learning, backpropagation, and neural networks. He won the 2018 Turing Award.

### More Recent Statements (2024-2025)

In his Nobel Prize interview (2024, for Physics), Hinton said:

> "In between 5 and 20 years from now there's a good chance, a 50% chance, we'll get AI smarter than us."

> "The question is what's going to happen when we've created beings that are more intelligent than us, and we don't know what's going to happen. We've never been in that situation before."

He defines "smarter" practically: "They can crush you in a debate, come up with solutions you'd never think of, and quickly understand new things."

## Counterpoints or Complications

1. **Hinton's framing is about worst-case scenarios.** The quote is often cited as a prediction, but he explicitly framed it as "conceivable," answering a hypothetical about worst cases.

2. **Hinton's own explanation implies necessity, not replacement.** "You need biological intelligence to evolve so that it can create digital intelligence." This is closer to parenthood or succession than extinction.

3. **"Passing phase" doesn't specify what comes next.** Hinton's fuller explanation suggests digital intelligence succeeds biological. But it doesn't preclude merger, coevolution, or hybrid forms.

## Gaps in Research

- Couldn't access the full video/transcript from MIT Technology Review (403 error)
- Would benefit from finding any Hinton statements specifically about merger/coevolution scenarios
