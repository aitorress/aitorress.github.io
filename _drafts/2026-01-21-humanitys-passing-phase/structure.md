# Proposed Structure: The Baton We Didn't Know We Were Carrying

**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Awaiting approval

---

## Core Argument

"Passing phase" doesn't mean extinction—it means evolution. Humanity has always been defined by its tool-relationships, and AI is just the latest chapter in a 2.6-million-year story of becoming.

## Piece Type

**Tension-driven** — but the tension resolves toward curiosity and evolution, not dread. The piece challenges the apocalyptic reading of Hinton's quote and offers a reframe grounded in paleoanthropology and the extended mind thesis.

## Proposed Outline

### 1. The Quote That Sounds Like Doom
**Purpose:** Hook. Establish the provocation that the piece will respond to.
**Content:** Hinton's quote from EmTech Digital 2023: "I think it's quite conceivable that humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence." Note how it lands—sounds apocalyptic, final.
**Estimated length:** Short paragraph

---

### 2. What Most People Hear
**Purpose:** Acknowledge the default interpretation before pivoting away from it.
**Content:** The knee-jerk reading: AI replaces us, we become obsolete, Terminator vibes. This is how the quote usually circulates. But look closer at what Hinton actually said.
**Estimated length:** Short paragraph

---

### 3. The Word That Changes Everything
**Purpose:** First pivot. Introduce the reframe.
**Content:** "Conceivable." Not inevitable. Not likely. Conceivable. He was answering a question about worst-case scenarios. And his fuller explanation: "You need biological intelligence to evolve so that it can create digital intelligence." We're not the thing being replaced. We're the origin.
**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph
**Source:** Hinton research

---

### 4. Passing Into What?
**Purpose:** Deepen the reframe. "Passing phase" assumes we know what comes next.
**Content:** The phrase "passing phase" implies we stop existing. But what if we're passing *into* something, not *out of* existence? Evolution doesn't work by replacement. It works by becoming.
**Estimated length:** Short paragraph

---

### 5. The Genus Defined by Tools
**Purpose:** Ground the reframe in deep history. This is the key move.
**Content:** Homo habilis—"handy man." We named ourselves after our tools. The progression: habilis (stone tools) → erectus (fire, hunting) → sapiens (language, writing, computers) → sapiens + AI (?). Each transition wasn't replacement. It was the next chapter. Each Homo was a "passing phase" into the next version of itself.
**Estimated length:** Medium-long paragraph
**Source:** Coevolution research, Homo habilis naming

---

### 6. We've Always Been Cyborgs
**Purpose:** Extend the argument with Andy Clark's extended mind thesis.
**Content:** "It's still a kind of ongoing cyborgification that we're living through." Tools aren't external to cognition—they're part of it. Notebooks extend memory. Calculators extend reasoning. AI extends... what? Maybe everything. The boundary between human and tool has always been porous.
**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph
**Source:** Extended mind research, Clark quotes

---

### 7. The Tool Needs a Wielder
**Purpose:** Ground in author's practitioner experience. Make it concrete.
**Content:** Author's perspective: "The tool is a tool, and as a tool it needs someone who wields it." Orders of magnitude improvement when wielding AI vs. not. Not every domain, not yet. But the practice is about pushing boundaries—of the tool and yourself. The frontier keeps moving.
**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph
**Source:** Author input

---

### 8. The Road, Not the Destination
**Purpose:** Landing. Resolve the tension.
**Content:** Maybe Hinton is right. Maybe we are a passing phase. But that's not news—we've always been passing into what comes next. The question isn't whether we're a phase. It's whether we're paying attention to the transition. "Passing phase" sounds like an ending. It might just be what Homo has always done: pick up a new tool and become something more.
**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph
**Source:** Synthesis of draft raw material + author input

## What's Not Included

| From Draft | Reason for Cutting |
|------------|-------------------|
| Fermi Paradox section | Tangential—doesn't serve the core argument about identity/evolution |
| "Democratization of godhood" | Too grandiose for the piece's grounded tone |
| Most of "Adjacent Ideas" list | Bibliography-dump feel; keeping only what's integrated (Clark, Hinton) |
| Detailed first/second-order effects | The piece isn't about consequences; it's about reframing identity |
| Buddhist non-attachment, Kuhn, Stewart Brand | Name-drops that don't earn their place |
| The consciousness counterargument | Author sidesteps via merger framing; doesn't need resolution |
| "How should we live?" urgency | Author doesn't feel urgency; piece lands on curiosity, not prescription |

## Open Questions

1. **Title:** "The Baton We Didn't Know We Were Carrying" still works (evolution/succession framing). But alternatives:
   - "Passing Into"
   - "What Homo Does"
   - "The Next Tool"
   - Keep current title?

2. **How personal?** Section 7 brings in author's practitioner experience. Should this be expanded with more specific examples, or keep it brief?

3. **Hinton's recent statements?** Include the Nobel Prize interview (2024) about "50% chance in 5-20 years," or keep focus on the original quote?

## Alternative Structures Considered

**Option B: Lead with Homo habilis**
Open with "We named ourselves after tools" and work backward to Hinton. Rejected because Hinton's quote is the more compelling hook—it's what the audience has likely encountered.

**Option C: More personal throughout**
Weave author's AI usage experience into multiple sections. Rejected because it might dilute the historical/philosophical argument. Better to concentrate personal experience in one section.

## Estimated Total Length

~800-1000 words (8 sections, varying lengths). Tight and focused.
