- [ ] Structure proposal
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Polish

## Key Direction from Author Input

**Major reframe:** The author's position is more optimistic than the draft suggests. They see "passing phase" as evolution, not extinction. The piece should land on merger/continuity rather than replacement.

**Emotional register:** Curiosity over dread. Exploratory, not anxious.

**Practitioner angle:** Author uses these tools daily. The tool-wielder framing ("orders of magnitude improvement when I wield the tool") could ground the piece in experience rather than abstraction.

## Open Questions

1. **Does the piece need the Hinton source?** The author's interpretation diverges from an apocalyptic reading anyway. Might be worth confirming context, but less critical now.

2. **How much consciousness debate?** Author resolves this simply: merger means the question matters less. Might not need deep research here.

3. **New title?** "The Baton We Didn't Know We Were Carrying" still works but might need revisiting given the evolution-not-replacement frame.

## Research Gaps (Revised Priority)

- Hinton quote context (lower priority now—author's interpretation stands on its own)
- Historical examples of tool-human coevolution (might be more relevant than "species transitions")
- Consciousness debate (low priority—author sidesteps it via merger framing)

## Notes

The draft as written leans into existential weight. Author's actual take is lighter, more curious. Structure should reflect this shift.

Strong raw material from author:
- "Who's to say it's not humanity's next evolution rather than something else?"
- "The tool is a tool, and as a tool it needs someone who wields it."
- "Push the boundaries of the tool and thus myself."
