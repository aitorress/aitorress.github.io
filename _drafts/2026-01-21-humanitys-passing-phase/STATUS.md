## Key Research Findings

### Hinton Quote Context
- Quote was a response to "worst-case scenario" question at EmTech Digital 2023
- Framed as "conceivable," not inevitable
- Fuller explanation: "You need biological intelligence to evolve so that it can create digital intelligence" — implies necessity, not just replacement
- Recent (2024): "50% chance we'll get AI smarter than us in 5-20 years"

### Tool-Human Coevolution (Extended Mind)
- **Homo habilis = "handy man"** — tool use is literally definitional to our genus
- Each Homo species is defined by its tool-relationship (habilis → erectus → sapiens)
- Human brains and tools have coevolved for 2.6 million years
- Andy Clark's "extended mind" thesis: tools aren't separate from cognition, they're part of it
- Language and tool use share neural circuits (Broca's area)
- Clark: "It's still a kind of ongoing cyborgification that we're living through"
- Supports author's framing: merger is natural, not alien

## Key Direction

**Author's position + research alignment:**
- Author sees "passing phase" as evolution, not extinction
- Research on extended mind supports this: we've always been tool-augmented beings
- Hinton's own elaboration ("you need biological intelligence") supports "bridge" framing
- The piece can position AI as the latest chapter in 2.6 million years of human-tool coevolution

## Open Questions

1. **New title?** Current title still works but might want something that signals evolution rather than succession.

2. **How much Hinton?** The piece could use him as a jumping-off point and then diverge (since author's reading differs from apocalyptic interpretations).

3. **Andy Clark as counterweight?** Clark's extended mind thesis could balance Hinton's warning with a "this is natural" perspective.

## Notes

Research strengthens the author's instinct. "Passing phase" doesn't have to mean replacement. The extended mind literature suggests humanity-with-AI is just the next form of humanity-with-tools.

Strong material for the piece:
- "You need biological intelligence to evolve so that it can create digital intelligence" (Hinton)
- "It's still a kind of ongoing cyborgification" (Clark)
- "Human brains and technology have been coevolving for 2.6 million years"
