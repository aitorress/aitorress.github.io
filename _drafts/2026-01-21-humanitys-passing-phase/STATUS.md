# The Baton We Didn't Know We Were Carrying — Status

## Current Phase
Analysis complete. Ready for author input.

## Completed
- [x] Idea expansion (2026-01-21)
- [x] Analysis (2026-01-23)

## In Progress
None

## Still Needed
- [ ] Author input (recommended next)
- [ ] Research (Hinton source, consciousness debate, AI trajectory data)
- [ ] Structure proposal
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Polish

## Open Questions

From analysis — must be resolved before structure:

1. **What's the author's actual stance?** The draft surveys the territory but doesn't commit to a position. Does the author find "passing phase" terrifying, liberating, both?

2. **Who is the audience?** AI insiders? General readers grappling with AI anxiety? This determines tone and how much to explain.

3. **Where should the piece land?** The "how should we live?" question is raised but unanswered. The piece needs a destination.

4. **How to handle the consciousness objection?** It's the strongest counterargument and currently underdeveloped. Needs either a real response or acknowledgment that it might defeat the thesis.

## Research Gaps Identified

- Hinton's actual quote/context (source needed)
- Consciousness and AI: what philosophers actually say
- Historical examples of "dominant form" transitions
- Moravec's specific predictions in "Mind Children"

## Notes

**Piece type:** Tension-driven. The Hinton quote is a provocation; the piece should feel like a response that takes the reader somewhere.

**Strengths to preserve:** Steel man argument, mitochondria metaphor, "most important / last that matters" paradox, best raw material lines.

**Watch out for:** Scope creep (Fermi Paradox, etc.), grandiosity ("democratization of godhood"), bibliography-dumping in Adjacent Ideas.
