## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Title | "Still Handy" |
| Section 7 | Expanded with jagged frontier + practitioner experience |
| Hinton 2024 | Skip — focus on reframe, not timelines |

## Key Research Findings

### Hinton Quote Context
- Quote was a response to "worst-case scenario" question at EmTech Digital 2023
- Framed as "conceivable," not inevitable
- Fuller explanation: "You need biological intelligence to evolve so that it can create digital intelligence" — implies necessity, not just replacement

### Tool-Human Coevolution (Extended Mind)
- **Homo habilis = "handy man"** — tool use is literally definitional to our genus
- Each Homo species is defined by its tool-relationship (habilis → erectus → sapiens)
- Human brains and tools have coevolved for 2.6 million years
- Andy Clark's "extended mind" thesis: tools aren't separate from cognition, they're part of it
- Clark: "It's still a kind of ongoing cyborgification that we're living through"

### Jagged Frontier (Ethan Mollick)
- AI capabilities are uneven: superhuman at some tasks, failing at others
- BCG study: 40% quality improvement, 25% faster — but 19% worse on tasks outside the frontier
- "Unless you use AI a lot, you won't know which is which"
- Grounds author's "tool needs a wielder" in research

## Notes

**Core argument:** "Passing phase" doesn't mean extinction—it means evolution. Humanity has always been defined by its tool-relationships, and AI is just the latest chapter.

**Estimated length:** ~900-1100 words (8 sections)

**Tone:** Curiosity over dread. Exploratory, not anxious.
