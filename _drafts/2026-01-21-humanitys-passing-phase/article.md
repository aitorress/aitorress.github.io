# Still Handy

Geoffrey Hinton, one of the architects of deep learning, said something a few years ago that I keep coming back to: "I think it's quite conceivable that humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence."

*Passing phase.*

The quote circulates in AI discourse like a warning label. Most people read it as doom. I'm not sure that's right.

When this quote makes the rounds—on Twitter threads, in tech podcasts, at dinner parties where someone's had too much wine—the interpretation is always the same. AI replaces us. We become obsolete. Skynet, but with better marketing. The story writes itself: superintelligence arrives, decides we're either a threat or an inconvenience, and that's that. Humanity had a good run.

It's a clean narrative. Terrifying, but clean. And it's not how I took it.

Look at the word he used: *conceivable*. Not inevitable. Not likely. Not even probable. Conceivable. He was answering a question about worst-case scenarios at a conference, and his fuller explanation is worth reading: "You need biological intelligence to evolve so that it can create digital intelligence."

We're not the thing being replaced. We're the origin. The necessary precondition. The quote that sounds like a death sentence is actually a birth announcement—we're the species that creates what comes next.

But here's what really caught me: "passing phase" assumes we know what comes after. The phrase implies we stop existing—that there's a clean break between us and whatever follows. But evolution doesn't work by replacement. It works by becoming. What if we're not passing *out* of existence, but passing *into* something?
