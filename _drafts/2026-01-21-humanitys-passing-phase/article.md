Geoffrey Hinton, one of the architects of deep learning, said something a few years ago that I keep coming back to: "I think it's quite conceivable that humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence."

*Passing phase.*

The quote circulates in AI discourse like a warning label. Most people read it as doom. I'm not sure that's right.
