# Still Handy

Geoffrey Hinton, one of the architects of deep learning, said something a few years ago that I keep coming back to: "I think it's quite conceivable that humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence."

*Passing phase.*

The quote circulates in AI discourse like a warning label. Most people read it as doom. I'm not sure that's right.

When this quote makes the rounds—on Twitter threads, in tech podcasts, at dinner parties where someone's had too much wine—the interpretation is always the same. AI replaces us. We become obsolete. Skynet, but with better marketing. The story writes itself: superintelligence arrives, decides we're either a threat or an inconvenience, and that's that. Humanity had a good run.

It's a clean narrative. Terrifying, but clean. And it's not what Hinton actually said.
