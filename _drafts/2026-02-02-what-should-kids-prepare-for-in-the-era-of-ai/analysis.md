# Draft Analysis: What Should Kids Prepare For in the Era of AI?

*Analyzed: 2026-02-02*

## Core Idea

**The skills that make you resilient to AI disruption are exactly the skills that AI disrupts your ability to build**—and this paradox falls hardest on kids entering the workforce, leaving parents without reliable career guidance for the first time in generations.

## Piece Type

**Tension-driven** — The piece centers on an uncomfortable paradox (the multiplier problem for new entrants) and challenges conventional career wisdom (STEM = safe, creative = risky). It doesn't offer clean solutions because the honest answer is uncertainty.

## What's Working

- **The central paradox is genuinely sharp.** "AI multiplies what's there, but new entrants don't have anything to multiply yet" is a clean formulation of a real problem.

- **The calculator analogy lands.** "The calculator came after the multiplication tables. AI came before the fundamentals." This is concrete and intuitive.

- **The asymmetric impact framing is structurally sound.** Starting with "mid-career professionals are fine" before pivoting to "but their kids aren't" creates productive tension.

- **Devil's Advocate doesn't pull punches.** The pushback on survivorship bias in the creative reversal hypothesis and the "maybe kids develop different judgment" counterargument are genuinely challenging.

- **Raw Material section has usable one-liners.** Several are sharp enough to build sections around.

- **The "Tension You're Sensing" section names it well.** Identifying the collective action problem and the parenting dilemma adds depth beyond the individual career question.

## Gaps to Fill

### Needs Research

1. **Calculator transition in education** — The piece asserts the calculator analogy but doesn't have specifics. What did the actual research show? How long did the debate take? What was the consensus? This could anchor the argument concretely.

2. **Harvard/BCG "jagged frontier" study** — Referenced but not detailed. Need specifics: what percentage improved, what percentage got worse, what defined the boundary?

3. **Job polarization data (David Autor)** — Mentioned in Adjacent Ideas but not developed. What does the data actually show about middle-skill job trends? How fast is this happening?

4. **Early AI adopters in the workforce** — Any data on how recent graduates are actually experiencing AI at work? Are they feeling the paradox or finding workarounds? Real-world evidence would test the thesis.

5. **Historical parallel specifics** — GPS navigation, spell-check, telephone operators. These are mentioned but could use concrete data (e.g., "telephone operators went from X to Y between years A and B").

### Needs Author Input

1. **What's your actual advice to your kids right now?** — The piece frames parental uncertainty but doesn't reveal what you're actually doing. Are you steering them toward anything? Away from anything? This personal stake would ground the abstraction.

2. **Do you believe the creative reversal hypothesis or are you just exploring it?** — The piece presents it as a possibility but doesn't commit. What's your actual credence? This matters for tone.

3. **What's your timeline assumption?** — The piece mentions "conservative AGI timelines (5-10 years)" but doesn't say what you believe. If AGI is 5 years away, the advice changes dramatically. What are you betting on?

4. **Have you seen the new-entrant paradox in your own work?** — You're an AI architect. Do you see junior people struggling with this? Do you have concrete examples (anonymized) of the pattern?

5. **What do you think about the "delay AI usage" strategy?** — The piece presents it as a possible coping mechanism but questions whether it's viable. Do you think it's actually good advice or a losing strategy?

### Needs More Thinking

1. **The "depth vs breadth" section is underdeveloped.** — It's stated as a structural insight but not really argued. Why does depth + AI beat breadth? What's the mechanism? This needs more than assertion.

2. **The class dimension is raised but dropped.** — Question 6 asks about inequality in AI-free skill-building time. This feels like it could be a major theme but it's buried in a question. Decide: is this central or tangential?

3. **The timeline problem undermines the whole piece.** — If AGI arrives in 5 years, does any of this matter? The piece acknowledges this but doesn't resolve it. Need a stance on how to give advice under radical uncertainty.

4. **"What does 'fundamentals' mean in an AI world?" is unresolved.** — The piece assumes we know what fundamentals are, but maybe they're different now. Judgment and taste are mentioned, but these are vague. What specifically should kids practice?

## Consider Cutting

- **Some of the Second-Order Effects feel speculative.** "The authenticity premium" and "delayed adulthood (again)" are interesting but may dilute the core argument. Consider whether they earn their place.

- **Adjacent Ideas section is dense.** Not all connections need to survive into the final piece. Goodhart's Law and Antifragility are interesting but may be tangential. The calculator parallel is essential; others are optional.

- **Some Questions Worth Exploring may be better as thinking prompts than article content.** Questions 2 (beneficiary question) and 3 (historical parallel) might be more useful for the author than the reader.

## Recommended Next Steps

**Run `/draft-research` first** on:
1. Calculator transition in education
2. Harvard/BCG jagged frontier study details
3. Job polarization data

**Then run `/draft-input`** to get:
1. Your actual parenting approach
2. Your timeline assumptions
3. Your credence on the creative reversal hypothesis
4. Concrete examples from your work

The piece has strong bones but needs grounding—both in external evidence and in your personal stake. The research will make the argument more credible; the author input will make it more alive.
