## Research Summary

### Key Data Points

**Jagged Frontier Study (Harvard/BCG 2023):**
- 758 consultants, AI users: +12.2% more tasks, +25.1% faster, +40% quality
- **Critical finding:** Novices experienced 19-percentage-point performance DROP when AI was unreliable
- Experts succeeded by identifying and rejecting flawed AI suggestions

**Calculator Transition:**
- Consensus: fundamentals first (K-5), calculators introduced grade 6-7
- Research confirms: premature use creates dependency
- Complication: Schools had decades to figure this out; workforce doesn't

**Job Polarization (Autor):**
- 30-year pattern: middle-skill jobs declining, pressure downward for non-college workers
- Driver: automation of routine tasks—exactly what AI targets

**Internal Blog Connections:**
- "The Unbundling of Work" — tasks vs jobs, ATM/teller data, timeline compression
- "The Human Edge" — curation, signal, trust as the new scarce goods
- "The Foundation Paradox" (draft) — directly argues why fundamentals matter more with AI
- "Vibecoding vs Expertise" (draft) — vertical vs horizontal expansion framework

## Author Input Summary

### Key Positions

**On parenting advice:** "Study whatever makes you happy" — but this comes from honest uncertainty, not conviction. Bullish on coding principles and creativity both being important.

**On AGI timelines:** Timeline-agnostic. "I don't have a prediction, nor do I think it's important. The path is the same regardless." Value will be derived by smart people at every step until AGI/ASI.

**On creative vs. technical:** Not binary. "The people I highly regard are people both highly creative AND experts in their domain."

### Concrete Example: The Ticket Completion Problem

Engineers reward-hacking for ticket completion produce poor quality work (AI-assisted, no human review). This creates more work for seniors reviewing it, which increases their skepticism of AI.

This is the new-entrant paradox in action: juniors using AI to appear productive → seniors catching errors → seniors become skeptical → adoption slows → juniors still aren't building fundamentals.

### What to Emphasize
- Lead with parenting honesty (uncertainty, not false confidence)
- Use the ticket completion example (concrete, relatable)
- Frame as timeline-agnostic (advice robust across scenarios)
- Creativity + expertise, not either/or

### What to Minimize
- Heavy timeline speculation
- Binary creative vs. technical framing

## Key Decisions Made
- Piece type: Tension-driven (paradox at center)
- Core tension: "Skills that make you resilient are exactly what AI disrupts your ability to build"
- Framing: Timeline-agnostic preparation
- The "ticket completion" example is the concrete anchor for the new-entrant paradox

## Notes
- The skepticism spiral (juniors → seniors → organizational slowdown) is an underexplored second-order effect worth developing
- Consider leading with the honest parenting angle: "study what makes you happy" as uncertainty, not wisdom
- Research strongly supports the thesis; author input adds personal stakes and concrete examples
