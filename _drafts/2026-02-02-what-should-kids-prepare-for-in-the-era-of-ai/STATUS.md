## Research Summary

### Key Data Points for the Article

**Jagged Frontier Study (Harvard/BCG 2023):**
- 758 consultants, AI users: +12.2% more tasks, +25.1% faster, +40% quality
- **Critical finding:** Novices experienced 19-percentage-point performance DROP when AI was unreliable (outside frontier)
- Experts succeeded by identifying and rejecting flawed AI suggestions
- Supports: "AI is most useful to people who need it least"

**Calculator Transition:**
- Consensus: fundamentals first (grades K-5), calculators introduced grade 6-7
- Research confirms: premature use creates dependency; appropriate use doesn't harm development
- Key parallel: "The use of calculators cannot replace understanding mathematical concepts, skills and human reasoning"
- Complication: Schools had decades to figure this out; workforce doesn't

**Job Polarization (Autor):**
- 30-year pattern: high-skill and low-skill jobs grow, middle-skill jobs decline
- For non-college workers, pressure is almost exclusively downward
- Driver: automation of routine (procedural, rule-based) tasks
- Pattern consistent across U.S. and 16 European countries
- AI may accelerate this—cognitive middle-skill work is exactly what AI targets

**Internal Blog Connections:**
- "The Unbundling of Work" — tasks vs jobs, ATM/teller data, timeline compression
- "The Human Edge" — curation, signal, trust as the new scarce goods
- "The Foundation Paradox" (draft) — directly argues why fundamentals matter more with AI
- "Vibecoding vs Expertise" (draft) — vertical vs horizontal expansion framework

## Open Questions
1. What's your actual credence on AGI timelines? This affects everything.
2. Is the class dimension (unequal access to AI-free skill-building) central or tangential?
3. Do you want to commit to the creative reversal hypothesis or present it as open?
4. What specific "fundamentals" should kids practice? Judgment and taste are vague.
5. How much should this piece reference your existing work vs. stand alone?

## Key Decisions Made
- Piece type: Tension-driven (paradox at center, challenges conventional wisdom)
- Core tension named: "Skills that make you resilient are exactly what AI disrupts your ability to build"
- Research supports the thesis strongly—jagged frontier study provides hard data on novice disadvantage

## Notes
- The 19-percentage-point novice performance drop is the killer statistic
- Calculator research supports the "sequence matters" argument but highlights that workforce lacks schools' structural control
- Internal blog pieces form a coherent framework—consider a "Related Reading" section
- Autor's polarization data suggests the stakes are real but pre-AI; AI may change the pattern
