- [x] Analysis (2026-02-02)

## In Progress
[None]

## Still Needed
- [ ] Research: Calculator transition in education
- [ ] Research: Harvard/BCG jagged frontier study
- [ ] Research: Job polarization data (Autor)
- [ ] Author input: Personal parenting approach, timeline assumptions, concrete examples
- [ ] Structure proposal
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Polish

## Open Questions
1. What's your actual credence on AGI timelines? This affects everything.
2. Is the class dimension (unequal access to AI-free skill-building) central or tangential?
3. Do you want to commit to the creative reversal hypothesis or present it as open?
4. What specific "fundamentals" should kids practice? Judgment and taste are vague.

## Key Decisions Made
- Piece type: Tension-driven (paradox at center, challenges conventional wisdom)
- Core tension named: "Skills that make you resilient are exactly what AI disrupts your ability to build"
- Recommended path: Research first (ground the argument), then author input (add personal stake)

## Notes
- The calculator analogy is the strongest concrete hook—worth developing with real data
- Consider cutting some second-order effects if they dilute the core argument
- The parenting angle needs personal grounding to avoid feeling abstract
