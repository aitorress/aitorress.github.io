## Key Decisions Made
- **Title:** "What Should Kids Prepare For in the Era of AI?" (keep original)
- **Piece type:** Tension-driven (paradox at center)
- **Core tension:** "Skills that make you resilient are exactly what AI disrupts your ability to build"
- **Framing:** Timeline-agnostic preparation
- **Ticket completion example:** Keep high-level, no additional specifics
- **Close:** "Study what makes you happy" + "build something worth multiplying" — approved

## Notes
- Estimated length: ~1,800-2,200 words
- Link to "The Unbundling of Work" in section 2
- Link to "The Human Edge" in section 9
- The 19% novice performance drop is the killer statistic (section 7)
