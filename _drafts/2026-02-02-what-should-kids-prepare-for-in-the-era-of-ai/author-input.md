### Personal Experience

**The Dinner Table Reality:**
"I think as a good father I'd say they study whatever makes them happy, but also this comes from a place where I don't know where the world is going to be in a couple of years."

This is honest parenting under uncertainty—not conviction dressed as wisdom. The "study what makes you happy" advice isn't a dodge; it's an acknowledgment that traditional career heuristics are breaking.

**Specific bullishness:**
- Coding principles: "I'm bullish will continue to be very important"
- Creativity: "will probably be VERY important as well"

**The Ticket Completion Problem (concrete example of new-entrant paradox):**
"When engineers are reward hacking for 'ticket completion', how poor the work is in terms of quality because you know they are using AI and you can see how there was no human in the loop review or the AI was misguided."

**The downstream effect:**
"This gives more work to the manager or senior engineers who use the time reviewing this (not doing useful things) and thus increasing their skepticism in AI."

This is the paradox in action: juniors using AI to appear productive → seniors spending time catching errors → seniors become skeptical of AI → adoption slows → but the juniors still aren't building fundamentals.

### Author's Position

**On AGI Timelines:**
"I don't have a prediction, nor do I think it's important. I think my actions and the path is the same regardless."

This is a strong position: timeline-agnostic preparation. The advice doesn't change whether AGI is 3 years or 10 years away.

"Value will be derived by smart people in every step of the process until we reach AGI/ASI. This will help us prepare or serve as training grounds."

**Anchoring to industry leaders (for the piece):**
- Dario Amodei (Anthropic): AGI by 2026-2027, possibly 12-24 months; AI will "replace the work of all software developers within a year"
- Demis Hassabis (DeepMind): More cautious—50% chance of AGI by end of decade (2030)
- Both agree: "this is happening faster than most people realize, the disruption will be severe"

**On Creative Reversal Hypothesis:**
"I'm not sure tbh, but even in today's standards, the people I highly regard are people both highly creative AND experts in their domain."

Not a binary choice. The answer might be: creativity alone isn't enough, expertise alone isn't enough, but the combination is defensible.

### What to Emphasize

1. **The ticket completion example** — this is concrete, relatable, and demonstrates the paradox without abstraction
2. **Timeline-agnostic framing** — "the path is the same regardless" is a more useful stance than predicting
3. **The "happy" answer is honest uncertainty** — don't pretend to know what you don't know
4. **Creativity + expertise, not creativity OR expertise** — the people worth emulating have both

### What to Cut or Minimize

- Heavy timeline speculation (author doesn't find it useful)
- Binary framing of creative vs. technical paths

### Raw Quotes

### Implications for the Piece

1. **Lead with the parenting honesty** — "study what makes you happy" sounds like a cop-out but is actually the most honest answer under uncertainty

2. **Use the ticket completion example** — it's a perfect illustration of the new-entrant paradox that readers in tech will immediately recognize

3. **Frame as timeline-agnostic** — don't anchor to specific AGI predictions; instead argue that the preparation path is robust across timelines

4. **Reframe creative vs. technical** — the answer isn't "be creative instead of technical" but "the combination is what the people you admire actually have"

5. **The skepticism spiral** — juniors misusing AI → seniors cleaning up → seniors skeptical of AI → organizational adoption slows. This is an underexplored second-order effect.
