# Research: Job Polarization (David Autor)

*Researched: 2026-02-02*

## Summary

David Autor's research documents a 30-year shift in employment: demand increased for high-skill and low-skill workers while middle-skill jobs declined. The key driver is automation of "routine" tasks—procedural, rule-based work that characterizes middle-skill occupations. For non-college workers, polarization has been almost exclusively downward, pushing them from specialized middle-skill jobs into low-wage generic work. This pattern is consistent across the U.S. and Europe.

## Key Findings

### 1. The Polarization Pattern

**Finding:** Over the past 30 years, the economy has increased demand for high-skilled (high-wage) workers and low-skilled (low-wage) workers, while opportunities for middle-skilled (middle-wage) jobs have declined. This U-shaped employment distribution is known as "job polarization."

- **Credibility:** High (Brookings Institution policy paper based on peer-reviewed research)
- **How to use:** This is the structural backdrop for career advice—the "middle" is hollowing out, so you need to be either at the top (expertise) or accept lower-wage work.

### 2. Automation as the Driver

**Finding:** The key contributor to polarization is automation of routine work. "Routine tasks"—procedural, rule-based activities—characterize middle-skill occupations. Whether manual or cognitive, routine tasks share the trait of being increasingly performed by machines.

- **Credibility:** High (Federal Reserve Bank analysis)
- **How to use:** AI accelerates this pattern. Middle-skill cognitive work (the kind new graduates often do) is exactly what AI automates.

### 3. The Non-College Worker Impact

**Finding:** Among non-college workers, polarization has exerted pressure almost exclusively *downward*. Almost all occupational change among non-college workers reflects movement from the middle toward the bottom. Technology change has been "broadly deskilling"—narrowing the set of jobs where non-college workers perform specialized work commanding higher pay.

- **Credibility:** High (National Bureau of Economic Research, peer-reviewed)
- **How to use:** This is the harsh reality beneath the "learn to code" advice. Without credentials/expertise, the path is down, not up. AI likely accelerates this.

### 4. The Geographic Dimension

**Finding:** Automation and international trade have eliminated the bulk of non-college production, administrative support, and clerical jobs, yielding disproportionate polarization of urban labor markets. The unwinding of the urban non-college occupational skill gradient has abetted a secular fall in real non-college wages.

- **Credibility:** High (MIT research)
- **How to use:** Geographic advice for kids: where you live matters. But even that's complicated by remote work and AI.

### 5. International Consistency

**Finding:** The polarization phenomenon is not limited to the U.S. In research covering 16 European countries, low-wage occupations increased relative to middle-wage occupations in all 16 countries. The U.S. and EU patterns are strikingly similar.

- **Credibility:** High (American Economic Review, peer-reviewed)
- **How to use:** This isn't a U.S.-specific problem. The advice holds globally.

### 6. The Great Recession Accelerated Polarization

**Finding:** The Great Recession reinforced polarization trends rather than reversing them. Between 2007-2009: essentially no net change in high-skill professional and low-skill service occupations, but employment fell 8% in white-collar administrative jobs and 16% in blue-collar production jobs.

- **Source:** [Brookings Paper](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/04_jobs_autor.pdf)
- **Credibility:** High
- **How to use:** Crises accelerate structural trends. AI adoption may function similarly—compressing decades of change into years.

## Counterpoints or Complications

1. **Polarization data is pre-AI.** Most of Autor's data covers 1980-2020. AI is a different beast—it may automate *cognitive* non-routine work, changing the pattern entirely.

2. **"Service jobs" aren't immune.** The low-skill service jobs that absorbed displaced middle-skill workers (food service, retail, care work) may also face AI/automation pressure.

3. **Autor himself is cautious about AI predictions.** In recent work, he's noted that AI could actually *reverse* polarization by making high-skill work more accessible—or it could accelerate it. The direction is uncertain.

4. **Education isn't a guarantee.** College graduates have fared better, but credential inflation and debt loads complicate the "just get a degree" advice.

## Gaps in Research

- Limited data on how AI specifically (vs. earlier automation) affects polarization
- Unclear whether AI will hollow out the top as well as the middle
- No consensus on whether the pattern will continue or shift
