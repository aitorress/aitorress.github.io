# Author Input: The Unbundling of Work

*This file will hold the author's perspectives, personal experiences, and decisions on questions raised during analysis.*

## Questions for Author

1. **Personal experience with task unbundling:** What tasks in your own work has AI changed or could AI handle? How has this affected your sense of what your job actually is?

2. **Meaningful work question:** Are there tasks you'd refuse to offload because doing them is part of why the work is meaningful to you?

3. **The core question:** Where do you actually land on "Am I more than the sum of my tasks?" Are you optimistic, pessimistic, or genuinely uncertain?

## Author Responses

### On job titles as labels (2026-01-27)
Agrees that jobs are labels for many tasks — this explains why job titles have different expectations across companies and teams. The same title can mean very different task bundles depending on context.

### On simplistic-task jobs
Notes the obvious case where people's jobs are mainly simplistic tasks. Not inherently good or bad, but these are the ones that will be impacted the most by AI automation.

### On job transformation
Jobs will merge and transform to fill vacuums left by automated tasks. The labor market will reorganize around what remains.

## Session: 2026-01-27 (Deep Input)

### The Core Question — Author's Position

**Optimistic, but not naive.** Two key reasons:

1. **The jagged frontier:** Many tasks fall outside what AI can reliably do. Jobs with those tasks survive.

2. **The trust/accountability gap:** Even when AI *can* do the task, there's still a trust issue. Users want someone accountable for results. Doctors, for example—even if AI analyzes lab results perfectly, people want a human to weigh in. This creates durable demand for human involvement in high-stakes work.

But also clear-eyed: "A lot of human labor is basically automated tasks that are going to be washed out by AI."

### Personal Experience — The Software Engineering Sandwich

Author is a software engineer who's seen firsthand how the work has transformed:

**Old loop:** gather clean requirements → implement code → test

**New loop:** The first and last phases now "sandwich" implementation. It's becoming more important to:
- State requirements cleanly
- Have a solid way to test (even if AI-assisted)
- ...than to actually write the code yourself

**What this freed up:** Focus shifted to things the author 1) cares more about and 2) leverage their "unique humanness":
- Architecting systems
- Organizing workflows
- Understanding pros vs. cons
- Making judgment calls

**Key quote:** "This doesn't necessarily mean I'm less of an engineer in any way shape or form."

Also notes financial analysts are being transformed similarly—software engineering is just the easiest to see.

### On High-Stakes Tasks and Accountability

Comfortable giving high-risk tasks to AI *if* inside the jagged frontier, but **always reviewed by a human who can be accountable**.

Examples:
- Code review (AI drafts, human reviews)
- Medical diagnosis: "I can get my lab results analysis from a very smart AI, but I also want a doctor to weigh in—it's the best of both worlds"

### The Hot Take

**Jobs don't get reduced in the long run—they get transformed.**

Short-term caveat: Companies need to show operational gains and ROI, so they might use AI to cut costs initially. But long-term trajectory is transformation, not elimination.

### Target Audience

**People anxious about their jobs.** The piece should speak to that anxiety directly.

## Synthesis for Draft Expansion

### Author's Angle
Optimistic but grounded. Not "AI will never take your job" cheerleading, but "the job transforms around what AI can't do, and there's more of that than you think."

### Personal Story to Include
The software engineering sandwich is concrete and vivid. Shows task unbundling happening *right now* in a knowledge profession—and the author's job didn't shrink, it refocused on higher-value work.

### Key Tension to Preserve
The "jagged frontier" creates safety, but also uncertainty. You don't know which of your tasks are inside vs. outside until AI tries them.

### What to Emphasize
- The accountability/trust gap as a durable source of human value
- Transformation, not elimination (long-term view)
- The anxiety is real, but the pattern from history + the author's experience suggests adaptation

### Potential Raw Quotes
- "A lot of human labor is basically automated tasks that are going to be washed out by AI."
- "It's the best of both worlds" (on AI + human review)
- "This doesn't necessarily mean I'm less of an engineer"
- "Jobs don't get reduced—they get transformed"
