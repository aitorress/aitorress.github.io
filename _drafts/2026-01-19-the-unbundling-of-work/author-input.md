## Questions for Author

1. **Personal experience with task unbundling:** What tasks in your own work has AI changed or could AI handle? How has this affected your sense of what your job actually is?

2. **Meaningful work question:** Are there tasks you'd refuse to offload because doing them is part of why the work is meaningful to you?

3. **The core question:** Where do you actually land on "Am I more than the sum of my tasks?" Are you optimistic, pessimistic, or genuinely uncertain?
