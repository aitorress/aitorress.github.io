# Author Input: The Unbundling of Work

*This file will hold the author's perspectives, personal experiences, and decisions on questions raised during analysis.*

## Questions for Author

1. **Personal experience with task unbundling:** What tasks in your own work has AI changed or could AI handle? How has this affected your sense of what your job actually is?

2. **Meaningful work question:** Are there tasks you'd refuse to offload because doing them is part of why the work is meaningful to you?

3. **The core question:** Where do you actually land on "Am I more than the sum of my tasks?" Are you optimistic, pessimistic, or genuinely uncertain?

## Author Responses

### On job titles as labels (2026-01-27)
Agrees that jobs are labels for many tasks — this explains why job titles have different expectations across companies and teams. The same title can mean very different task bundles depending on context.

### On simplistic-task jobs
Notes the obvious case where people's jobs are mainly simplistic tasks. Not inherently good or bad, but these are the ones that will be impacted the most by AI automation.

### On job transformation
Jobs will merge and transform to fill vacuums left by automated tasks. The labor market will reorganize around what remains.
