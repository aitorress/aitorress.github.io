# Proposed Structure: The Unbundling of Work

**Status:** Approved
**Date:** 2026-01-27

---

## Core Argument

AI won't take your job wholesale—it'll take tasks from it, and your job will reshape around what remains. But you need to actively map your own "jagged frontier" to know which tasks are which, and the people who avoid AI will be the ones caught off guard.

## Piece Type

**Tension-driven** — Optimistic framing ("jobs transform, not disappear") but honest about the risks (some jobs really are mostly automatable tasks, speed of change matters, wages can still fall).

## Headings

**Yes, but selective** — No heading for the hook or close. Headings for the substantive sections to help anxious readers navigate.

---

## Proposed Outline

### 1. [No heading — just dive in]
**Purpose:** Meet the reader where they are. Acknowledge the fear without dismissing it.
**Content:** Open with the feeling of seeing AI do something you thought was *your* thing. Don't start with "AI is transforming work"—start with the gut punch of watching it happen.
**Tone:** Personal, immediate. Not academic.
**Estimated length:** Short paragraph (3-4 sentences)

---

### 2. Your Job Is a Label, Not a Unit
**Purpose:** Introduce the core insight that changes how you think about automation risk.
**Content:**
- Jobs aren't indivisible units—they're bundles of tasks wearing a label
- The job title is a fiction; the daily grind is a mix of activities
- AI doesn't automate "jobs"—it automates tasks within jobs
- Use the author's line: "Job titles have different expectations across companies and teams because the task bundle varies"
**Source:** Draft "Seed" section, author input
**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph

---

### 3. We've Seen This Before
**Purpose:** Show this pattern has played out before, with data.
**Content:**
- **ATM-teller paradox:** Tellers per branch dropped 20→13, but branches grew 43%, so employment grew. The job shifted from cash handling to relationship banking.
- **But the story has an ending:** Wages have since dropped 25%, employment now declining. The pattern isn't timeless optimism—it's "jobs survive for a while, then the next wave hits."
- **Telephone operators:** 350k at peak → 5k today. But it took 86 years. Speed matters.
- **The real lesson:** Automation affects tasks first, employment later. The question is how much later.
**Source:** Research files (Bessen, Richmond Fed, Burning Glass)
**Estimated length:** Long section (2-3 paragraphs)

---

### 4. But Some Jobs Really Are Just Tasks
**Purpose:** Don't let the reader think this is pure optimism. Acknowledge the real risks.
**Content:**
- Some jobs really *are* mostly automatable tasks. If the "kernel of irreducible humanness" is too small, the job deflates or disappears.
- The carpenter analogy has survivor bias. Carpentry survived; telephone operators didn't. Which one is your job closer to?
- Middle management is already feeling it: job postings down 40%+ since 2022. Amazon, TCS, Salesforce making explicit cuts. "The human API layer" is getting automated.
- Speed of transition is the crux: telephone operators had 86 years. If AI compresses that into 5-10, the "jobs transform" story is technically true but socially catastrophic.
**Source:** Draft "Devil's Advocate," research on middle management
**Estimated length:** Medium-long section (2 paragraphs)

---

### 5. What I've Seen: The Software Engineering Sandwich
**Purpose:** Ground the abstract argument in personal experience. Show task unbundling happening *right now* in a knowledge profession.
**Content:**
- Author's old loop: gather requirements → implement code → test
- New loop: requirements and testing "sandwich" the implementation. It's becoming more important to state requirements cleanly and test thoroughly than to write the code yourself.
- What this freed up: architecture, workflows, judgment calls—the "unique humanness" parts
- Key quote: "This doesn't mean I'm less of an engineer—it means I focus on different parts"
- Other professions (financial analysts, etc.) are seeing similar patterns—software is just the easiest to see
**Source:** Author input
**Estimated length:** Medium section (1-2 paragraphs)

---

### 6. Two Reasons for Optimism (That Aren't Cope)
**Purpose:** Give the reader a framework for why some human value is durable.
**Content:**
- **The jagged frontier:** AI isn't uniformly capable. Some tasks fall outside what it can reliably do. Your job survives if enough of your tasks are on the human side of that frontier.
- **The accountability gap:** Even when AI *can* do the task, people still want humans accountable. "I can get lab results analysis from a smart AI, but I want a doctor to weigh in—it's the best of both worlds."
- These aren't permanent shields, but they're real for now—and "for now" might be a long time for high-stakes, trust-dependent work.
**Source:** Author input (jagged frontier, accountability)
**Estimated length:** Medium section (1-2 paragraphs)

---

### 7. Map Your Own Frontier
**Purpose:** Turn the analysis into something the reader can do.
**Content:**
- The frontier isn't a static limit—it's something you map by using the tools
- People who avoid AI because "it can't do my job" are missing the point. They're staying ignorant of their own vulnerabilities.
- Golf club analogy: iron, driver, wood are all great—but not at the same tasks. Mastery means knowing which fits which shot.
- Practical suggestion: Audit your task bundle. What can AI do now? In 2 years? What probably still needs you? The percentage breakdown will either reassure or alarm you—but at least you'll know.
**Source:** Author input (frontier as tool, golf analogy), draft "Next Steps"
**Estimated length:** Medium section (1-2 paragraphs)

---

### 8. [No heading — just land it]
**Purpose:** Land the piece. Not a summary—a final thought that stays with them.
**Content:**
- Return to the core tension: "Am I more than the sum of my tasks?"
- The honest answer: maybe. The only way to find out is to test the boundary.
- Jobs don't get reduced in the long run—they get transformed. But transformation requires you to participate, not hide.
- Final line options:
  - "The question isn't whether AI can do your job. It's whether you know which parts of your job are actually yours."
  - "Power tools didn't kill carpenters. They killed the version of carpentry that was mostly sawing."
**Source:** Draft raw material, author's hot take
**Estimated length:** Short paragraph (3-4 sentences)

## What's Not Included

| Cut | Reason |
|-----|--------|
| **Second-Order Effects section** (job as unit dissolving, education disruption, status hierarchies, surveillance) | Too speculative for this piece's focus. Could be a follow-up post. |
| **Coase's theory of the firm** | Interesting but tangential. Doesn't serve the anxious reader. |
| **Cal Newport / Deep Work connection** | Adds complexity without advancing the core argument. |
| **Buckminster Fuller** | Doesn't earn its place. |
| **"Questions Worth Exploring" section** | These were thinking prompts, not article content. The strong ones are folded into the structure. |
| **Radiology example** | Research showed the 80% claim was unsupported. Replaced with accountability framing using the doctor/lab results example. |

## Open Questions

1. **Title:** Keep "The Unbundling of Work: Why AI Won't Kill Your Job, Just Reorganize It"? Or something punchier? The subtitle is accurate but long.

2. **How personal to go in section 5?** The software engineering story is good, but should it include more specific examples (e.g., "yesterday I used Claude to...")? Or keep it at the pattern level?

3. **Include the "short-term cuts are ROI theater" point?** The author's hot take acknowledges short-term layoffs. Should the piece address this directly, or does it complicate the optimistic frame too much?

---

## Alternative Structures Considered

**A. Lead with personal story** — Open with the software engineering sandwich, then zoom out to the framework. Rejected because anxious readers need the reframe before the example; otherwise it reads as "I'm fine, so you'll be fine."

**B. Heavy historical focus** — Spend more time on ATM/teller and telephone operator stories. Rejected because the piece should serve the reader's anxiety about *their* job, not be a history lesson. Historical evidence supports but doesn't dominate.

**C. Include second-order effects** — The "job as unit dissolving" and "surveillance intensifies" threads are interesting but would make the piece 2500+ words and dilute the call to action. Better as a follow-up.

## Estimated Total Length

~1500-1800 words. Long enough to be substantive, short enough to read in one sitting.
