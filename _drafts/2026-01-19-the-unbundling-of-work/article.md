You blocked three hours for the task. Deep work, no meetings. You're kind of dreading it, if you're honest. It's the kind of work that needs doing but doesn't spark joy. On a whim, you decide to see if AI can help. You write a prompt, hit enter, watch it think.

It finishes in minutes. The output is good. Really good. You stretch, victorious, already planning what to do with your reclaimed afternoon.

Then the second thought arrives: *that's what they pay me for.*

The magic trick gets less fun after that.

## Your Job Is a Label, Not a Unit

That second thought lingers. You start noticing things. The task AI just handled? You've done it hundreds of times. It's part of your job but, to be honest (and you know this), it's not the whole thing. There's so much that goes around that task that it's merely a cog in a larger machine. There's the part where you figure out *what* needs doing. The part where you explain the results to someone who doesn't get it. The part where you make the call when the data isn't clear.

Your job isn't one thing. It's a bundle of things wearing a single title. "Software engineer" can be 80% writing code at one company and 80% meetings and architecture decisions at another. "Financial analyst" can be 80% spreadsheets at one firm and 80% client calls at another. The title is a convenient fiction. The work is what actually fills your days.

And AI doesn't automate jobs. It automates tasks. Once you see your work as a bundle rather than a single block, the question changes. It's not "Will AI take my job?" It's "Which tasks in my bundle can it do, and what's left when they're gone?"

## We've Seen This Before

This isn't the first time a technology came for the tasks inside a job. The ATM was supposed to kill bank tellers. Instead, something strange happened: ATMs reduced the number of tellers needed per branch from 20 to 13, but that made branches cheaper to operate. Banks opened more branches. Teller employment actually *grew* for decades. The job shifted from counting cash to selling financial products and managing customer relationships. The tasks changed; the job survived.

But here's the part that doesn't make the optimistic version of the story: it's reversing now. Teller wages have dropped about 25% since the early 2010s. Employment is declining. The job title survives, but the economics underneath it have eroded. The ATM didn't kill the teller. It just took forty years to finish the job.

Then there are the telephone operators. At peak, 350,000 of them, almost all women, connecting calls by hand. Today, fewer than 5,000. The job didn't transform. It disappeared. But it took 86 years from the first automated switchboard to the last manual one. That's a long time to adapt.

The lesson isn't "automation kills jobs" or "automation saves jobs." It's that automation affects tasks first, employment later. The question is always: how much later? The telephone operators had decades. We might have years.
