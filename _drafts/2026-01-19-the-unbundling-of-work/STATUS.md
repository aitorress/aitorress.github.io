## Key Research Findings

### Historical Evidence
- **ATM-Teller Paradox:** Tellers per branch dropped 20→13, but branches grew 43%, so employment grew. BUT: wages have since dropped 25%, employment now declining 8%.
- **Telephone Operators:** 350,000 at peak → 5,000 today. Took 86 years (1892-1978) from invention to full phase-out.
- **Key insight:** Speed of transition matters enormously. The "jobs reorganize" story can be true but socially catastrophic if compressed.

### Current AI Evidence
- **Middle management:** Job postings down 40%+ since 2022. Amazon, TCS, Salesforce making explicit cuts.
- **Radiology:** 48% using AI, Swedish trial showed 44% workload reduction on mammograms. Augmentation, not replacement (so far).
- **Task unbundling is now explicit:** 62% of orgs experimenting with AI agents. Microsoft/PwC using "task unbundling" framework.

### What the Draft Should Address
1. The ATM story is *not* timeless optimism — it's reversing now
2. The 80% radiologist claim appears unsupported — use actual data
3. Middle management pressure is real and documented
4. Speed of transition is the crux: telephone operators had 86 years, we might have 5-10

## Open Questions

1. ~~Does the author have personal experience with task unbundling?~~ ✓ Yes — software engineering "sandwich"
2. ~~Where does the author land on the core question?~~ ✓ Optimistic but not naive
3. Is the transition speed problem worth developing, or should it be a separate piece?
4. Who captures the productivity gains? (Job survives ≠ workers are fine) — partially addressed by accountability framing

## Author Input Received

- Agrees jobs are labels for task bundles — explains variance in job titles across companies
- Notes simplistic-task jobs will be impacted most (not inherently good or bad)
- Believes jobs will merge and transform to fill vacuums left by automation
- **Position:** Optimistic but grounded — jagged frontier + trust/accountability gap = durable human value
- **Personal experience:** Software engineering transformed from "implement code" to "sandwich" of requirements + testing
- **Hot take:** Jobs transform, don't reduce (long-term); short-term cuts are ROI theater
- **Audience:** People anxious about their jobs

## Notes

- Piece type: Tension-driven (optimistic framing undermined by existential questions)
- Core strength: Steel Man and Devil's Advocate sections are solid
- Main weakness: Abstract and theoretical — now has concrete examples from research
- Recommended next step: /draft-structure to outline the expanded piece
