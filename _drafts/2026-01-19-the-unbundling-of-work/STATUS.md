# The Unbundling of Work — Status

## Current Phase
Analysis

## Completed
- [x] Analysis (2026-01-27)

## In Progress
[None]

## Still Needed
- [ ] Research (gaps identified — radiologist data, bank teller details, concrete AI examples, historical occupational decline)
- [ ] Author input (gaps identified — personal stakes, meaningful work question, author's position on core question)
- [ ] Structure proposal
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Polish

## Open Questions

1. Does the author have personal experience with task unbundling to ground the abstract argument?
2. Where does the author actually land on "Am I more than the sum of my tasks?" — needs commitment
3. Is the transition speed problem worth developing, or should it be a separate piece?
4. Does the surveillance/measurement thread deserve more space or its own post?

## Notes

- Piece type: Tension-driven (optimistic framing undermined by existential questions)
- Core strength: Steel Man and Devil's Advocate sections are solid
- Main weakness: Abstract and theoretical — needs concrete examples and personal stakes
- Recommended path: /draft-research then /draft-input before structuring
