Prioritized revision items, highest ROI first:

## 1. Trim Section 6 — too many threads competing
**Status:** completed

- **Issue:** Both critics flag S6 as overloaded. Six distinct threads competing for attention.
- **Why it matters:** S6 is the piece's most important counterweight but overloading it dilutes every individual point.
- **Suggested fix:** Keep ClawHub+paradox, SOAP/REST, and non-dev users. Cut institutional support, compress non-dev paragraph.
- **Resolution:** Cut institutional support paragraph entirely, folded key point (Linux Foundation backing) into SOAP/REST paragraph. Compressed non-dev + enterprise IT from 4 sentences to 3. S6 now has 4 focused threads instead of 6.

## 2. Strengthen the close — end on a position, not a question
**Status:** completed

- **Issue:** Close ended with a question mark ("overengineered for whom, and for when?") that deflated the argument.
- **Why it matters:** The close is the last thing the reader carries.
- **Suggested fix:** Personal beat + practical ending.
- **Resolution:** Added personal callback to catalog discovery ("After I opened that catalog..."), described author's own setup, ended on "write a skill, point it at a CLI, move on." Period. Cut USB-C reprise (already used in S4).

## 3. Add numbers to the progressive disclosure argument
**Status:** completed

- **Issue:** No token cost data in a piece about infrastructure economics.
- **Why it matters:** Without numbers, the progressive disclosure argument reads as opinion. With them, analysis.
- **Suggested fix:** Back-of-napkin token count estimate.
- **Resolution:** Added: "forty to fifty tool schemas... easily eight to ten thousand tokens before the agent does anything useful" and "at a thousand agent calls a day, that's millions of wasted tokens — real money, not theoretical efficiency."

## 4. Expand the hook — stay with the catalog discovery
**Status:** declined

- **Issue:** Hook resolves before the reader feels the tension.
- **Resolution:** Author decided current brevity is intentional. Skipped.

## 5. Verify or cut the Armin Ronacher reference
**Status:** completed

- **Issue:** Named attribution without a verifiable source.
- **Resolution:** Cut specific attribution. Replaced with generalized "Developers who'd been running MCP servers started migrating." The "markdown files don't break at 3am" line carries the same insight without needing a named source.

## 6. Show the CLI advantage with a concrete scene
**Status:** declined

- **Issue:** S3 explains when it could show.
- **Resolution:** Author decided current version is sufficient. Skipped.

## 7. Consider the title
**Status:** completed

- **Issue:** "The Tool Stack" is a label, not a thesis.
- **Resolution:** Changed to "Of MCPs and Skills." Literary cadence, names the subject directly, doesn't telegraph the argument — lets the hook do the selling.
