## Revision Summary

5 of 7 revision items completed, 2 declined by author:

1. **S6 trimmed** — Cut institutional support paragraph, folded Linux Foundation point into SOAP/REST. Compressed non-dev paragraph. 6 threads → 4.
2. **Close rewritten** — Personal callback to catalog discovery + "write a skill, point it at a CLI, move on." Cut question-mark ending.
3. **Numbers added** — Token counts in S2: "forty to fifty tool schemas... eight to ten thousand tokens" + "millions of wasted tokens" at scale.
4. **Hook expansion** — Declined. Author prefers current brevity.
5. **Ronacher cut** — Removed specific attribution. Generalized to "developers who'd been running MCP servers." Resolves the unverified source concern.
6. **CLI scene** — Declined. Current version sufficient.
7. **Title changed** — "The Tool Stack" → "Of MCPs and Skills."

## Enrichment Summary

Added three enrichments (~110 words, ~1,480 → ~1,590):
- **S2**: "Markdown files don't break at 3am" one-liner
- **S4**: "The agent doesn't care" insight — execution layer doesn't change capability, only operational burden
- **S5**: N×M one-liner — "strongest argument for MCP that almost nobody encounters in practice — yet"
- **S6**: Security paradox — skills needing governance starts looking like MCP
