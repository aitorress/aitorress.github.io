## Polish Summary

### Voice pass
- Removed contrastive negation in S2 ("He didn't switch because X. He switched because Y." → just the positive claim)
- Varied close opener from "Skills didn't kill MCP" (would be 3rd instance of pattern) to "Skills pushed MCP to where it belongs"
- Cut recap phrases that opened S3, S4, S5 ("Skills won the instruction layer. That's the headline." / "So skills won..." / "So the full stack looks like...")
- Smoothed definitions paragraph ("For the unfamiliar:" → "Quick definitions if you need them:")

### Tightening (~1,650 → ~1,480 words, ~10% cut)
- Compressed "Worse is Better" list from three examples (Unix/Lisp, REST/SOAP, JSON/XML) to one (REST/SOAP) since it returns in S6
- Cut "was so obviously right that it" throat-clearing in S2
- Compressed IP protection question from 4 sentences to 3
- Cut S3 recap opener and "Consider GitHub specifically" throat-clearing
- Cut redundant operational details in S3 that echoed the hook
- Trimmed ClawHub paragraph slightly (parenthetical → inline)
- Cut "These aren't hypothetical requirements. They're table stakes for any company that takes compliance seriously."

### Source links added
- "Worse is Better" → dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html

- Armin Ronacher: URL not found via search (blog post may not exist or isn't indexed). Left as mention without link.

## Remaining Concerns

- Consider running /draft-enrich if the piece feels too lean after reading.
