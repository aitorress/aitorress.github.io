# The Great Unbundling of MCP — Status

## Current Phase
Author input complete — ready for structure

## Completed
- [x] Idea expansion (2026-02-09)
- [x] Analysis (2026-02-09)
- [x] Author input (2026-02-09)

## In Progress
[None]

## Still Needed
- [ ] Research (optional — token efficiency numbers, ClawHub details, skills catalog breakdown)
- [ ] Structure proposal
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Polish

## Open Questions
1. ~~Is this a landscape synthesis or a tension-driven argument?~~ → Tension-driven, organized around the friend conversation and author's own contradiction (defends MCP intellectually, avoids it experientially)
2. ~~Does Code Mode deserve a full section?~~ → No. Author has no conviction. Mention in a line at most.
3. ~~Which analogies survive?~~ → Worse-is-better and Christensen disruption. Cut Conway's Law, POSIX, recipe/kitchen.
4. ~~What's the author's verdict?~~ → Full stack is skills + MCP + CLI. MCP is the optional middle layer you strip when you don't need security, standardization, IP protection, or determinism.
5. How much of the friend conversation to include directly vs. paraphrase? (Still open — decide during structure)

## Key Decisions from Author Input
- **Article thesis:** MCP is the optional middle layer. Default to skill + CLI; add MCP when four conditions demand it (complexity, hidden IP, determinism, N×M standardization).
- **Cut Code Mode** down to a mention.
- **Cut academic analogies** (Conway's Law, POSIX). Keep Worse-is-Better and Christensen only if they serve the argument naturally.
- **Author's voice is terse and practical** — the article should match. Don't sprawl into predictions.
- **Friend conversation is the spine**, not seasoning.

## Notes
- Author has never personally hit a case where MCP was the right answer over a simpler alternative. MCP advocacy is intellectual, not experiential. This tension IS the article.
- Skills are unremarkable by design — they work, you move on. No dramatic "skill saved the day" stories. That's the point.
- The four decision axes (complexity, IP, determinism, standardization) are the most concrete, actionable material from this session. Could become the structural heart of the piece.
