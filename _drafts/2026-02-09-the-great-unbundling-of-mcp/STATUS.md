## Enrichment Summary

Added three enrichments (~110 words, ~1,480 → ~1,590):
- **S2**: "Markdown files don't break at 3am" one-liner after Ronacher mention
- **S4**: "The agent doesn't care" insight — execution layer doesn't change capability, only operational burden
- **S5**: N×M one-liner — "strongest argument for MCP that almost nobody encounters in practice — yet"
- **S6**: Security paradox — skills needing governance starts looking like MCP

Re-polish pass confirmed voice consistency, no AI-tells introduced.

## Polish Summary

### Voice pass
- Removed contrastive negation in S2 ("He didn't switch because X. He switched because Y." → just the positive claim)
- Varied close opener from "Skills didn't kill MCP" (would be 3rd instance of pattern) to "Skills pushed MCP to where it belongs"
- Cut recap phrases that opened S3, S4, S5 ("Skills won the instruction layer. That's the headline." / "So skills won..." / "So the full stack looks like...")
- Smoothed definitions paragraph ("For the unfamiliar:" → "Quick definitions if you need them:")

### Tightening (~1,650 → ~1,480 words, ~10% cut)
- Compressed "Worse is Better" list from three examples (Unix/Lisp, REST/SOAP, JSON/XML) to one (REST/SOAP) since it returns in S6
- Cut "was so obviously right that it" throat-clearing in S2
- Compressed IP protection question from 4 sentences to 3
- Cut S3 recap opener and "Consider GitHub specifically" throat-clearing
- Cut redundant operational details in S3 that echoed the hook
- Trimmed ClawHub paragraph slightly (parenthetical → inline)
- Cut "These aren't hypothetical requirements. They're table stakes for any company that takes compliance seriously."
