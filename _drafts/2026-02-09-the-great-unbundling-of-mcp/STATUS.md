# The Great Unbundling of MCP — Status

## Current Phase
Analysis

## Completed
- [x] Idea expansion (2026-02-09)
- [x] Analysis (2026-02-09)

## In Progress
[None]

## Still Needed
- [ ] Author input (priority — personal experience, position commitment, Code Mode verdict)
- [ ] Research (optional — token efficiency numbers, ClawHub details, skills catalog breakdown)
- [ ] Structure proposal
- [ ] Expansion
- [ ] Polish

## Open Questions
1. Is this a landscape synthesis or a tension-driven argument? (Analysis recommends tension-driven, using friend convo as spine)
2. Does Code Mode deserve a full section or should it be cut?
3. Which 2-3 analogies survive? (Worse-is-better and Christensen disruption are strongest)
4. What's the author's actual verdict on where the boundary settles?
5. How much of the friend conversation to include directly vs. paraphrase?

## Notes
- Unusually research-heavy for this stage — 15+ sources already gathered in raw notes
- The friend conversation is the most distinctive material; no other article has this angle
- Author's published voice is first-person, conversational, commits to positions — current draft is more analytical/balanced than typical output
- Consider "The Unbundling of Work" as structural model: hook → build → counter → commit → question
