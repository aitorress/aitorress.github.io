## Second Revision Summary

5 of 5 items completed:

1. **Definitions paragraph cut** — Removed glossary paragraph after hook. Terms already defined through context.
2. **ClawHub tightened** — Kept fragment list and typosquatting detail, cut "attack vector was straightforward" explanation.
3. **S2 paragraph split** — Break after "gave them back." "A skill is a markdown file" now opens its own paragraph.
4. **Security paradox / SOAP/REST breathing room** — Added transitional sentence between paradox and SOAP/REST parallel.
5. **S4 double hedge reduced** — "Here's the thing, though" → "But". Kept "I'd bet" per Housel's recommendation.

## Revision Summary

5 of 7 revision items completed, 2 declined by author:

1. **S6 trimmed** — Cut institutional support paragraph, folded Linux Foundation point into SOAP/REST. Compressed non-dev paragraph. 6 threads → 4.
2. **Close rewritten** — Personal callback to catalog discovery + "write a skill, point it at a CLI, move on." Cut question-mark ending.
3. **Numbers added** — Token counts in S2: "forty to fifty tool schemas... eight to ten thousand tokens" + "millions of wasted tokens" at scale.
4. **Hook expansion** — Declined. Author prefers current brevity.
5. **Ronacher cut** — Removed specific attribution. Generalized to "developers who'd been running MCP servers." Resolves the unverified source concern.
6. **CLI scene** — Declined. Current version sufficient.
7. **Title changed** — "The Tool Stack" → "Of MCPs and Skills."

## Enrichment Summary

Added three enrichments (~110 words, ~1,480 → ~1,590):
- **S2**: "Markdown files don't break at 3am" one-liner
- **S4**: "The agent doesn't care" insight — execution layer doesn't change capability, only operational burden
- **S5**: N×M one-liner — "strongest argument for MCP that almost nobody encounters in practice — yet"
- **S6**: Security paradox — skills needing governance starts looking like MCP

## Second Polish Summary (2026-02-11)

### Voice pass
- Replaced 5 em dashes with colons, commas, parentheses, or periods
- Tightened "And here's what that means in practice:" → "In practice:"
- Cut meta-phrase "the article's thesis in one line"
- Fixed passive "has been made redundant" → "is now redundant"

### Tightening
- Cut "on every call" (implied by "upfront")
- Cut "and other agent platforms" from cross-vendor paragraph (Codex is the signal)
- Cut "It's seen these tools in thousands of contexts during training" (preceding sentences cover it)
- Cut redundant CLI list from S3 (already listed in paragraph above)
- Tightened "Every service with a mature CLI is a service where an MCP server adds" → "is one where MCP adds"
