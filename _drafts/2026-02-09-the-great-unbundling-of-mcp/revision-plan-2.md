Prioritized revision items, highest ROI first:

## 1. Cut or minimize the definitions paragraph
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Galloway flags it as a speed bump after the hook's strong reversal. The people reading this article already know what skills and MCP are, or will learn from context.
- **Why it matters:** The hook builds momentum through paragraphs 1-3. The definitions paragraph (line 14) kills that momentum with a glossary. The reader who got hooked by "Skills didn't kill MCP. They unbundled it." doesn't want to stop for definitions.
- **Suggested fix:** Cut entirely. The article already defines skills through use ("a markdown file that teaches the agent what to do") and MCP through contrast ("the execution layer"). If the author wants to keep it, reduce to one sentence or push to a footnote.
- **Questions to resolve:** Does the author's audience genuinely need definitions? Or is this a safety blanket?

## 2. Tighten the ClawHub paragraph
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Galloway: punchy fragment list ("Credential exfiltration. Session theft.") AND detailed explanation of the attack vector is serving two audiences at once.
- **Why it matters:** It's the longest paragraph in the piece. Density works against the punch.
- **Suggested fix:** Keep the fragment list and the typosquatting detail (specific, surprising). Cut or compress the "attack vector was straightforward" explanation. The fragments already imply the severity.
- **Questions to resolve:** Does the author want to prioritize impact (keep fragments, cut explanation) or education (keep explanation, cut fragments)?

## 3. Split S2 paragraph 2
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Housel flags six ideas in one paragraph: cross-vendor adoption, migration pattern, operational pain, "markdown files don't break," Worse is Better, REST/SOAP.
- **Why it matters:** The "markdown files don't break at 3am" line deserves to open its own paragraph. It's the best line in the piece and it's currently buried in the middle of a dense block.
- **Suggested fix:** Break after "gave them back." New paragraph starts: "A skill is a markdown file. An MCP server is a service."
- **Questions to resolve:** None. This is a formatting change with no content risk.

## 4. Give the security paradox and SOAP/REST parallel breathing room
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Housel notes these are two big ideas in quick succession. The paradox is philosophical; the SOAP/REST parallel is historical. Both compress in the reader's mind when stacked.
- **Why it matters:** Each is strong enough to land on its own. Together they compete.
- **Suggested fix:** Add a short transitional sentence before the SOAP/REST paragraph, or add one sentence of implication after the paradox before moving on. Even a line break would help.
- **Questions to resolve:** Does the author want to expand either, or just add visual separation?

## 5. Reduce double hedge in S4 opener
**Status:** pending

- **Issue:** Galloway: "Here's the thing, though" + "I'd bet" is hedging twice. Housel disagrees (likes "I'd bet"). They agree the pivot needs to feel honest, not tentative.
- **Why it matters:** S4 is where the article turns from arguing for skills to acknowledging MCP's persistence. Too much hedging undercuts the turn.
- **Suggested fix:** Keep "I'd bet" (Housel is right that it earns trust). Consider whether "Here's the thing, though" can be tightened or cut. "But open a skill catalog..." might be enough.
- **Questions to resolve:** Author preference. This is a tone call.
