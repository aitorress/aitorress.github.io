# Research: Task Automation Historical Evidence

**Date:** 2026-01-27

## Summary

Historical evidence strongly supports the task-based view of automation. The ATM-bank teller case demonstrates that partial automation can increase employment through cost reduction and market expansion, though recent data shows this effect is reversing. Telephone operators represent the opposite case—near-complete task automation that genuinely eliminated the profession, though over 60+ years.

## Key Findings

### 1. ATM-Bank Teller Paradox: The Classic Case

**The core finding:** ATMs reduced tellers per branch from 20 to 13 between 1988 and 2004, but bank branches in urban areas increased 43%. Net result: teller employment *grew* for decades.

**The mechanism:** ATMs reduced the cost of operating a branch. Banks responded by opening more branches to compete for market share. Fewer tellers per branch × more branches = stable or growing employment.

**The job transformation:** Tellers shifted from cash handling to "relationship banking"—selling financial products, personal customer service. Banks began hiring more college graduates for teller roles.

- **Credibility:** High — Bessen is a leading labor economist, data comes from Bureau of Labor Statistics
- **How to use:** This is the draft's central example. The nuance matters: it worked because branches expanded and the remaining tasks were valuable.

**But the story has an ending:**

Recent data shows the pattern is reversing. The Burning Glass Institute found:
- Teller wages have *declined* from ~$70,000 to ~$52,000 (about 25% drop) since the early 2010s
- The Bureau of Labor projects teller employment to decline 8% over the next decade
- The job title survives but is transforming into "universal banker" roles requiring more complex skills

- **Credibility:** High — labor market research institute with access to job posting data
- **How to use:** Complicates the optimistic read. The teller story isn't "they survived"—it's "they survived for 30 years, then started declining, and wages fell."

### 2. Telephone Operators: The Elimination Case

**Peak employment:** 350,000 switchboard operators working for AT&T alone at peak. About 1 in 13 working women in 1950 were telephone operators.

**The timeline of decline:**
- 1892: First automated switching system invented
- 1919: AT&T installed first dial telephones
- 1930: Only one-third of Bell System exchanges had automatic switchboards
- 1940: Fewer than 200,000 operators remained
- 1978: Phase-out of all switchboard operators completed
- 1984: National employment down to 40,000
- 2021: Just 5,000 "telephone operators" + 69,900 "switchboard operators" remain
- BLS projects 20%+ decline by 2029

**Why it took so long (86 years from invention to completion):**
- Interdependencies with rest of AT&T's business
- Required complementary innovation across the firm
- WWI wage increases finally jolted management into action
- Infrastructure conversion takes decades

**What happened to displaced workers:**
NBER research found the shock "did not reduce future cohorts' employment rates"—but researchers caution this may be due to unique factors: rapid growth in women's education, labor demand, and labor force participation at the time.

- **Credibility:** High — Federal Reserve research, NBER peer review
- **How to use:** This is the counter-example to the carpenter analogy. The job really did disappear—but over 60+ years, not overnight. Speed matters.

### 3. The 98% Cloth Weaving Statistic

During the 19th century, 98% of the labor required to weave a yard of cloth was automated. Yet the number of weaving jobs actually *increased*.

**The mechanism:** Automation drove cloth prices down dramatically. Demand for cloth was highly elastic (people bought much more when it was cheaper). The increase in quantity demanded exceeded the labor savings per unit.

- **Source:** James Bessen, cited in [AEI](https://www.aei.org/economics/what-atms-bank-tellers-rise-robots-and-jobs/)
- **Credibility:** High — historical economic data
- **How to use:** This is the strongest version of the "partial automation increases jobs" argument. But note: it requires elastic demand. Knowledge work demand may not be as elastic as cloth demand was.

## Counterpoints and Complications

1. **Survivor bias is real.** Bank tellers and weavers survived; telephone operators, elevator operators, and typists didn't. The draft acknowledges this but could engage more with *what determines which category you're in*.

2. **The ATM story is now reversing.** Using it as a timeless example is misleading—it's better framed as "automation effects take decades to play out, and the early story isn't the final story."

3. **Speed of transition matters enormously.** Telephone operators had 86 years. If AI compresses equivalent change into 5-10 years, the "jobs reorganize" story may be true but socially catastrophic.

4. **Wages can fall even when employment is stable.** Bank teller wages dropped 25%. The "job survives" frame can obscure real economic harm to workers.

5. **Displacement outcomes depend on context.** Telephone operators transitioned okay, but that was during rapid expansion of women's labor force participation. Current context is different.

## Gaps in Research

- No good data on what percentage of radiologist work is "scan reading" vs. other tasks (the draft claims 80% but this appears unsupported)
- Limited research on how *fast* workers can actually retrain when their task bundle changes
- Need more examples of knowledge work unbundling happening *now*, not just projections
