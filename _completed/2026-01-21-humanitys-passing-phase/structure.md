# Approved Structure: Still Handy

**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Approved

---

## Core Argument

"Passing phase" doesn't mean extinction—it means evolution. Humanity has always been defined by its tool-relationships, and AI is just the latest chapter in a 2.6-million-year story of becoming.

## Piece Type

**Tension-driven** — but the tension resolves toward curiosity and evolution, not dread. The piece challenges the apocalyptic reading of Hinton's quote and offers a reframe grounded in paleoanthropology and the extended mind thesis.

## Approved Outline

### 1. The Quote That Sounds Like Doom
**Purpose:** Hook. Establish the provocation that the piece will respond to.
**Content:** Hinton's quote from EmTech Digital 2023: "I think it's quite conceivable that humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence." Note how it lands—sounds apocalyptic, final.
**Estimated length:** Short paragraph

---

### 2. What Most People Hear
**Purpose:** Acknowledge the default interpretation before pivoting away from it.
**Content:** The knee-jerk reading: AI replaces us, we become obsolete, Terminator vibes. This is how the quote usually circulates. But look closer at what Hinton actually said.
**Estimated length:** Short paragraph

---

### 3. The Word That Changes Everything
**Purpose:** First pivot. Introduce the reframe.
**Content:** "Conceivable." Not inevitable. Not likely. Conceivable. He was answering a question about worst-case scenarios. And his fuller explanation: "You need biological intelligence to evolve so that it can create digital intelligence." We're not the thing being replaced. We're the origin.
**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph
**Source:** Hinton research

### 4. Passing Into What?
**Purpose:** Deepen the reframe. "Passing phase" assumes we know what comes next.
**Content:** The phrase "passing phase" implies we stop existing. But what if we're passing *into* something, not *out of* existence? Evolution doesn't work by replacement. It works by becoming.
**Estimated length:** Short paragraph

---

### 5. The Genus Defined by Tools
**Purpose:** Ground the reframe in deep history. This is the key move.
**Content:** Homo habilis—"handy man." We named ourselves after our tools. The progression: habilis (stone tools) → erectus (fire, hunting) → sapiens (language, writing, computers) → sapiens + AI (?). Each transition wasn't replacement. It was the next chapter. Each Homo was a "passing phase" into the next version of itself.
**Estimated length:** Medium-long paragraph
**Source:** Coevolution research, Homo habilis naming

### 6. We've Always Been Cyborgs
**Purpose:** Extend the argument with Andy Clark's extended mind thesis.
**Content:** "It's still a kind of ongoing cyborgification that we're living through." Tools aren't external to cognition—they're part of it. Notebooks extend memory. Calculators extend reasoning. AI extends... what? Maybe everything. The boundary between human and tool has always been porous.
**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph
**Source:** Extended mind research, Clark quotes

---

### 7. Navigating the Jagged Frontier
**Purpose:** Ground in author's practitioner experience + Mollick's research. Make it concrete.
**Content:**
- Author's practitioner perspective: "The tool is a tool, and as a tool it needs someone who wields it."
- Orders of magnitude improvement when wielding AI vs. not
- But the frontier is jagged (Mollick): AI is superhuman at some tasks, fails at others. "Unless you use AI a lot, you won't know which is which."
- The practice is learning where the edges are—pushing boundaries of the tool and yourself
- BCG study: 40% quality improvement inside the frontier, but 19% worse outside it
- This is what tool-mastery has always looked like: learning where the tool works and where it doesn't
**Estimated length:** Medium-long paragraph (expanded)
**Source:** Author input + Jagged frontier research (Mollick)

### 8. The Road, Not the Destination
**Purpose:** Landing. Resolve the tension.
**Content:** Maybe Hinton is right. Maybe we are a passing phase. But that's not news—we've always been passing into what comes next. The question isn't whether we're a phase. It's whether we're paying attention to the transition. "Passing phase" sounds like an ending. It might just be what Homo has always done: pick up a new tool and become something more.
**Estimated length:** Medium paragraph
**Source:** Synthesis of draft raw material + author input

## Decisions Made

| Question | Decision |
|----------|----------|
| Title | "Still Handy" — punchy callback to Homo habilis |
| Section 7 depth | Expanded with jagged frontier research + practitioner experience |
| Hinton 2024 Nobel interview | Skip — keep focus on reframe, not timelines |

## What's Not Included

| From Draft | Reason for Cutting |
|------------|-------------------|
| Fermi Paradox section | Tangential—doesn't serve the core argument about identity/evolution |
| "Democratization of godhood" | Too grandiose for the piece's grounded tone |
| Most of "Adjacent Ideas" list | Bibliography-dump feel; keeping only what's integrated (Clark, Hinton, Mollick) |
| Detailed first/second-order effects | The piece isn't about consequences; it's about reframing identity |
| Buddhist non-attachment, Kuhn, Stewart Brand | Name-drops that don't earn their place |
| The consciousness counterargument | Author sidesteps via merger framing; doesn't need resolution |
| "How should we live?" urgency | Author doesn't feel urgency; piece lands on curiosity, not prescription |
| Hinton 2024 Nobel interview | Not needed; original quote + context is sufficient |

## Estimated Total Length

~900-1100 words (8 sections, with Section 7 expanded). Tight and focused.
