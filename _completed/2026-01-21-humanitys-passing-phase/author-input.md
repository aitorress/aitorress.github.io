# Author Input: The Baton We Didn't Know We Were Carrying

**Session:** 2026-01-23

## Author's Position

**The core reframe:** The author doesn't see "passing phase" as apocalyptic or even particularly sobering. They see it as *evolution*, not replacement. The next intelligent beings might not be separate from humanity—they might be humanity-with-tools, humanity's next form.

**On the Hinton quote:** Intellectual curiosity, not visceral dread. The quote looks apocalyptic but the author reads it differently: "Who's to say it's not humanity's next evolution rather than something else?"

**On consciousness:** Not a dealbreaker. Humanity *with* these tools might be the next evolution step. The boundary between human and AI might dissolve rather than one replacing the other.

**On urgency:** These changes don't happen overnight or from one day to another. No need to change daily behavior based on this framing.

## Personal Experience

**Tool-wielder framing:** The author uses AI as a practitioner, not a spectator. Key insight: "The tool is a tool, and as a tool it needs someone who wields it."

**Performance observation:** Orders of magnitude improvement when wielding the tool vs. not. But the tool isn't there yet in every domain.

**Practice orientation:** Actively trying to understand the frontier of the tool to push its boundaries—and their own. "Push the boundaries of the tool and thus myself."

## What to Emphasize

1. **Evolution, not extinction.** The piece should land on merger/continuity rather than replacement. The "passing phase" might pass *into* something that still includes us.

2. **The practitioner's perspective.** The author knows this from using the tools, not just thinking about them. The piece could benefit from this grounded, tool-user angle.

3. **Curiosity over dread.** The emotional register should be exploratory, not anxious.

## What to Cut or Minimize

- Apocalyptic framing or existential dread
- The implication that AI replaces humanity rather than merging with it
- Urgency about changing how we live (author doesn't feel this)

## Audience

General readers, tech workers, and technologists. Broad but tech-literate. Assume some familiarity with AI discourse but don't assume insider knowledge.

## Raw Quotes

- "Who's to say it's not humanity's next evolution rather than something else?"
- "The tool is a tool, and as a tool it needs someone who wields it."
- "I do see orders of magnitude in increased performance when I wield the tool vs when I don't."
- "I'm trying to practice or understand the frontier of the tool to be able to push the boundaries of the tool and thus myself."
- "Humanity with these tools might be the next evolution step. It's conceivable :)"

## Key Insight for Structure

The draft currently explores "passing phase" as potentially grim. But the author's actual take is more optimistic: we're not being replaced, we're evolving. The tool-wielder relationship suggests agency, not obsolescence.

**The piece might reframe from:** "We might be a passing phase—how do we cope?"
**To:** "We might be a passing phase—and that might mean we're becoming something more, not less."
