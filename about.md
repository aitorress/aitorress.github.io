Hey — my name’s Andres!

These days I work as a Lead AI Architect at NCLH, I’m a LangChain Ambassador, and I occasionally contribute to open source projects. I also sit on our AI Governance Board, where I help shape enterprise AI strategy and make sure “innovation” isn’t just an expensive hobby.

I didn’t get here through the usual route. I never studied software engineering formally — truth is, I’ve never even spun up my own database. Everything I know came from trial, error, and learning from people far smarter than me! I spent years in mobile engineering, always pulled toward that sweet spot where UI, UX, and engineering meet. Somewhere along the way, I realized I wasn’t just chasing shipped apps - I was chasing better experiences, whether for customers, engineers, or entire organizations.

Now my work lives at the intersection of AI, strategy, and people. I speak at events, mentor teams, and write here to expand my surface area for serendipity — sharing frameworks, experiments, and the occasional strong opinion. This blog is my way to test ideas in public, connect with interesting people, and chip away at the impostor syndrome… and my fear of getting booed off stage (spoiler: no one cares that much).

When I’m off the clock, I’m probably reading non-fiction (thinking frameworks, stoicism, psychology, economics), cooking (and eating and drinking well), listening to jazz, and confident that my short game will turn around any day now — much like it has for the past decade..

If something here sparks a thought, a debate, or even a “you’re wrong and here’s why,” let’s talk! I’m always up for a good conversation — preferably with coffee, whiskey, or a whiteboard in front of us.
